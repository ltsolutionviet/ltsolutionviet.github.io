            Right. So I’ll make a note of that. Now there are just one or two
            things you need to think about before the event. For example, you’ll
            have to see about getting a&nbsp;licence if you’re planning to have
            any <span class="explainq5 explain">music</span> during the meal.

            It’s quite straightforward, I’ll give you the details later on. And
            about a week or ten days before your event you’ll need to contact
            the caretaker, that’s Mr Evans, to&nbsp;make the arrangements for
            <span class="explainq6 explain">entry</span> - he’ll sort that out
            with you.

            <span class="explainq7 explain">stage</span> door there. You can
