      style="max-width: 400px; margin: auto;">
  </div>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, excuse me, I wonder if you’d have the time to take part in some market
      research?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Umm ... What’s it about?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About this club and your experiences and opinions about being a member. It’ll take
      less than five minutes.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh ... OK then ... as long as it’s quick.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can I start by taking your name?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s <span class="explainqe explain">Selina Thompson</span>.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is that T-H-O-M-P-S-O-N?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great, thanks ... And what do you do for a living?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I’m an <span class="explainq1 explain">accountant</span> but I’m between jobs
      at the moment.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I understand, but that’s the job I’ll put down on the form. And would you mind my
      asking which age group you fall into? Below thirty, thirty-one to fifty and above.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span class="explainq2 explain">Over fifty</span> ... I think we can safely
      say.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great, thanks. And which type of membership do you have?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sorry, I’m not sure what you mean? Do you mean how long ... ?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, is it a single person membership ... ?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh right ... no, it’s a <span class="explainq3 explain">family</span>
      membership.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks and how long have you been a member?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh ... let me see ... I was certainly here five years ago ... and it was probably
      two to three years more than that ...</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shall I put down eight?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I remember now ... it’s <span class="explainq4 explain">nine</span> ... definitely
      ... sorry.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No problem ... I’ve got that. And the last question in this first part is, what
      brought you to the club?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sorry ... ?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How did you find out about the club? Did you see any ads?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woman: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I did
      actually but I have to say I wasn’t really attracted to the club because of that. It&nbsp;</span><span
      style="font-weight: 400;">was through word of mouth.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Man: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span
      style="font-weight: 400;">So you were recommended by a friend?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woman: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually my
      <span class="explainq5 explain">doctor</span> ... I’d been suffering from high blood pressure and he said the club
      was&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">very supportive of people with that condition, so I signed
      up.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Man:
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Great ...
        thanks.</span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now for the second part of the form I want to ask a bit more about your experience
      of the club.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How often would you say you use the club ... ?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It varies enormously depending on how busy I am.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course ... but on average ... per month?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’d say it averages out at twice a week.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OK, so eight on average.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah. And four of those are aqua-aerobics classes.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That leads me to the next question ... would you say the <span
        class="explainq6 explain">swimming pool</span> is the facility you make most use of?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fair to say that ... yeah.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right, thanks ... And are there any facilities you don’t use?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One area I realise I’ve never used is the </span>tennis courts<span
      style="font-weight: 400;"> ... and there’s one simple reason for that ...</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t play tennis?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually, I’m not bad at it ... it’s that I’m not happy having to </span><span
      class="explainq7 explain">pay</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> extra ... for that
      <strong>privilege</strong>.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve made a note of that ... thanks. Now in the last section are there any
      <strong>suggestions</strong> or <strong>recommendations</strong> you have for <strong>improvements</strong> to the
      club?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only about health and fitness?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anything at all ...</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I’d like to see more </span><span class="explainq8 explain">social
      events</span> ... it isn’t just a question of getting together for games or classes but other things, you know.
  </p>
  <p>Yes, sure.</p>
  <p>And another thing that I was thinking when I had my yoga class in the gym last night - we were all sweltering in
    the heat - was that I think they should put in ... you know ... <span class="explainq9 explain">air
      conditioning</span>.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s exactly what I mean. The rooms are really light and well designed but they
      do need proper installations.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure ... well I’ve made a note of that ...</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">... so is there anything else you’d like to suggest ... about quality of service,
      for example?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, everyone’s very nice here ... they couldn’t be more friendly and helpful ... oh
      but I tell you what ... it’s a shame the <span class="explainq10 explain">restaurant</span> isn’t open in the
      evening on Saturday ... and Sunday as well for that matter.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So ... the club should ...</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">... open it later on those days.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OK . well thank you
          very much, that’s all the questions.</span></span></span></p>
