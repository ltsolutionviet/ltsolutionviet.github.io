  <p>Sure. How about taking your family for a cruise? <span class="explainqE explain">We have a steamship that&nbsp;</span><span class="explainqE explain">takes passengers out several times a day</span> - it’s over 100 years old.</p>

  <p>About an hour and a half. <span class="explainq1 explain">And don’t forget to take pictures of the mountains</span>.<br>They’re all around you when you’re on the boat and they look fantastic.</p>

  <p>Right. Well there are various things you can do once you’ve crossed the lake, to make a day of it. One thing that’s very popular is a visit to the Country Farm.<br>You’re met off the boat by the farmer and he’ll take you to the holding pens, where the sheep are kept. Children love feeding them!</p>

  <p>Well, <span class="explainq2 explain">there’s also a 40-minute trek round the farm on a horse</span>, if he wants.</p>

  <p>And again, visitors are welcome to explore the farm on their own, as long as they take care to close dates and so on. <span class="explainq3 explain">There are some very beautiful gardens along the side of the lake which also belong to the farm</span> - they’ll be just at their best now.

  <p>TC EMPLOYEE:</p>
  </td>

  <p>You can, and it’s very good. though it’s not included in the basic cost. You pay<br>when you get there.</p>

  <td>
  <p>TC EMPLOYEE:</p>
  </td>
  <td>
  <p>Well, what you can do is take a bike over on the ship and then go on a cycling trip. There’s a trail there called the Back Road - you could easily spend three or four hours exploring it. and the scenery’s wonderful. <span class="explainq5 explain">They’ll give you a map when you get your ticket for the cruise - there’s no extra charge</span>.</p>

  <p>TC EMPLOYEE:</p>
  </td>

  <p>Quite challenging in places. It wouldn’t be suitable for your seven-year-old. <span class="explainq6 explain">It needs someone who’s got a bit more experience</span>.</p>
  </td>

  <td>
  <p>VISITOR:</p>
  </td>
  <td>
  <p>Hmm. Well, my daughter loves cycling and so do I, so maybe the two of us could go, and my wife and son could stay on the farm. That might work out quite well. But we don’t have bikes here... is there somewhere we could rent them?</p>

  <p>TC EMPLOYEE:</p>

  <p>Yes, there’s a place here in the city. <span class="explainq7 explain">It’s called Ratchesons</span>.</p>

  <p>You’d also need to pick up a repair kit for the bike from there to take along with you, and you’d need to take along a snack and some water - it’d be best to get those in the city.</p>

  <p>TC EMPLOYEE:</p>
  </td>

  <p>Sure, you should definitely get that. It’s a great ride, but you want to be well prepared because <span class="explainq9 explain">it’s very remote - you won’t see get shops round there, or&nbsp;anywhere to stay</span>, so you need to get back in time for the last boat.</p>

  <p>TC EMPLOYEE:</p>
  </td>

  <p>Let’s see, that’d be one adult and one child for the cruise with farm tour, that’s $117, and an adult and a child for the cruise only so that’s $214 dollars altogether. Oh, wait a minute, how old did you say your daughter was?</p>

  <p>Then I’m afraid <span class="explainq10 explain">it’s $267</span> because she has to pay the adult fare, which is $75 instead of the child fare which is $22 - sorry about that.</p>
