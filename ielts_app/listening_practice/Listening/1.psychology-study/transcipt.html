  <p>SUPERVISOR:</p>
  <p>Hi, Joanna, good to meet you. Now, before we discuss your new research project, I’d like to hear something about
    the psychology study you did last year&nbsp;for your Master’s degree. So how did you choose your subjects for that?
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>JOANNA:</p>
  <p>Well, I had six subjects, all professional musicians, and all female. Three were violinists and there was also a
    cello player and a pianist and a flute player. They</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>were all very highly regarded in the music world and <span class="explainq2 explain">they’d done quite extensive
      tours in different continents</span>, and quite a few had won prizes and competitions&nbsp;as well.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>SUPERVISOR:</p>
  <p>And they were quite young, weren’t they?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>JOANNA:</p>
  <p>Yes, between 25 and 29 - the mean was 27.8. I wasn’t specifically looking for artists who’d <span
      class="explainq1 explain">produced recordings</span>. but this is something that’s just taken for&nbsp;granted
    these days. and they all had.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>SUPERVISOR:</p>
  <p>Right. Now you collected your data through telephone interviews, didn’t you?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>JOANNA:</p>
  <p>Yes. I realised if I was going to interview <span class="explainq4 explain">leading musicians</span> it’d only be
    possible over the phone because they’re so busy. I recorded them using a telephone&nbsp;recording adaptor. I’d been
    worried about the quality, but it worked out all&nbsp;right. I managed at least a 30-minute interview with each
    subject, sometimes&nbsp;longer.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>SUPERVISOR:</p>
  <p>Did doing it on the phone make it more stressful?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>JOANNA:</p>
  <p>I’d thought it might... it was all quite informal though and in fact they seemed</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>very keen to talk. And<span class="explainq3 explain"> I don’t think using the phone meant I got less rich data,
      rather the opposite in fact</span>.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>SUPERVISOR:</p>
  <p>Interesting. And you were looking at how performers dress for concert performances?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>JOANNA:</p>
  <p>That’s right. My research investigated <span class="explainq6 explain">the way players see their role as a musician
      and how this is linked to the type of clothing they decide to wear</span>. But</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>that focus didn’t emerge immediately. When I started I was more interested in trying to investigate the impact of
    what was worn on those listening, and also</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span class="explainq5 explain">whether someone like a violinist might adopt a different style of clothing
      from</span>, say, someone playing the flute or the trumpet.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>SUPERVISOR:</p>
  <p>It’s interesting that the choice of dress is up to the individual, isn’t it?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>JOANNA:</p>
  <p>Yes, you’d expect there to be rules about it in orchestras, but that’s quite rare.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>SUPERVISOR:</p>
  <p>You only had women performers in your study. Was that because male musicians are less worried about fashion?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>JOANNA:</p>
  <p>I think <span class="explainq7 explain">a lot of the men are very much influenced by fashion, but in social terms
      the choices they have are more limited</span> ... they’d really upset audiences if they&nbsp;strayed away from
    quite narrow boundaries.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>SUPERVISOR:</p>
  <p>Hmm. Now, popular music has quite different expectations. Did you read Mike Frost’s article about the dress of
    women performers in popular music?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>JOANNA:</p>
  <p>No.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>SUPERVISOR:</p>
  <p>He points out that <span class="explainq8 explain">a lot of female singers and musicians in popular music tend to
      dress down in performances, and wear less feminine clothes</span>, like jeans instead</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>of skirts, and he suggests this is because otherwise they’d just be discounted as <strong>trivial</strong>.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>JOANNA:</p>
  <p>But you could argue they’re just wearing what’s practical ... I mean, a pop-music concert is usually a pretty
    energetic affair.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>SUPERVISOR:</p>
  <p>Yes, he doesn’t make that point, but I think you’re probably right. I was interested by the effect of the audience
    at a musical performance when it came&nbsp;to the choice of dress.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>JOANNA:</p>
  <p>The subjects I interviewed felt this was really important. It’s all to do with what</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>we understand by performance as a public event. They believed the audience had certain expectations and it was up
    to them as performers to fulfil these&nbsp;expectations, to <span class="explainq9 explain">show a kind of
      esteem</span> ...</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>SUPERVISOR:</p>
  <p>... they weren’t afraid of looking as if they’d made an effort to look good.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>JOANNA:</p>
  <p>Mmm. I think in the past the audience would have had those expectations of one another too, but that’s not really
    the case now, not in the UK anyway.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>SUPERVISOR:</p>
  <p>No.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>JOANNA:</p>
  <p>And I also got interested in what sports scientists are doing too, with regard to clothing.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>SUPERVISOR:</p>
  <p>Musicians are quite <strong>vulnerable</strong> physically, aren’t they, because the movements they carry out are
    very <strong>intensive</strong> and repetitive, so I’d imagine <span class="explainq10 explain">some
      features&nbsp;of sports clothing could safeguard the players from the <strong>potentially</strong>
      dangerous&nbsp;effects</span> of this sort of thing.</p>
  <p>Q30</p>
  <p>JOANNA:</p>
  <p>Yes, but musicians don’t really consider it. They avoid clothing that obviously restricts their movements, but
    that’s as far as they go.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>SUPERVISOR:</p>
  <p>Anyway, coming back to your own research, do you have any idea where you’re going from here?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>JOANNA:</p>
  <p>I was thinking of doing a study using an audience, including ...</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
