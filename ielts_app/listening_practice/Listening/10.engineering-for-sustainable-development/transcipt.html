    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lecturer: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Good
            afternoon. This is the first of a series of lectures I’ll be giving about engineering for&nbsp;</span><span
            style="font-weight: 400;">sustainable development. I’ll be presenting examples of engineering projects from
            a variety of contexts, and today I’m going to talk about a project to design a new kind of greenhouse for
            use in the Himalayan mountain regions.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First of all, I’ll tell you about the problem which was the context for this
            project. In the Himalayan mountains, fresh vegetables and other crops can only be grown outside for about
            ninety days, during the summer, because the altitude of the region is around three thousand five hundred
            metres, and because the <span class="explainq1 explain">rainfall</span> is so low. In winter, temperatures
            fall below minus twenty-five degrees celcius, so fresh vegetables have to be imported. They arrive by truck
            in summer or by <span class="explainq2 explain">air</span> in winter, which makes them expensive. Local
            people rely on dried leafy vegetables and stored root crops during the winter, and rarely eat fresh
            vegetables.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite the sub-zero temperatures, the skies over the region are cloudless,
            and there are over three hundred sunny days per year. So an engineering solution was needed, to exploit the
            sun’s energy and protect locally produced plants from <span class="explainq3 explain">freezing</span> during
            winter. And in fact, there had been programmes in the past to provide greenhouses, but these were <span
                class="explainq4 explain">unsuccessful</span>. The greenhouses weren’t adapted for local conditions, so
            they tended to fall into disuse.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, a few years ago, a project was initiated to design a better greenhouse, one
            which would meet the criteria for sustainability.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lecturer: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what are
            the criteria for sustainability? Well, first of all, the new greenhouse is designed&nbsp;</span><span
            style="font-weight: 400;">to be relatively simple, so construction is <span
                class="explainq5 explain">cheap</span>. Locally available materials are used wherever possible. The
            walls are generally constructed of mud bricks, made locally, although in areas of high snow-fall more
            resilient walls of stone are needed. Rammed earth is also used. The main roof is generally made from locally
            available poplar wood, with water- resistant local <span class="explainq6 explain">grass</span> for the
            covering. In addition, the construction and maintenance of the greenhouse is done by local craftsmen. So
            local stone masons are employed to build the greenhouse walls, and specialised training is provided for them
            wherever necessary.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then... the greenhouse is designed to run on <span
                class="explainq7 explain">solar</span> power alone, there’s no supplementary heating. And lastly,
            families are selected to own one of the new greenhouses with great care. They have to have a <span
                class="explainq8 explain">site</span> which is suitable for constructing it on. They also have to be
            keen to make a success of using it, and also to share the produce with the wider community through sale or
            barter. Potential owners are taken to see existing greenhouses before they make a final decision about
            having one.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, those are the features which make the project sustainable. And now I’ll
            briefly describe the design of the greenhouse. The greenhouses are orientated very carefully along an East-
            West axis, so that there’s a long South-facing side. The transparent cover on the South­facing side is made
            from a heavy-duty polythene, which should last for at least five years.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the inside of the greenhouse, the <span class="explainq9 explain">walls</span>
            are painted - the rear and west-facing walls are&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">black, to
            improve heat absorption, but the east-facing wall is white to reflect the morning sunlight onto the crops
            inside. Finally, there’s a door in the wall at one end, and vents are incorporated into the roof, the door
            and the wall at the other end, to enable control of humidity and prevent overheating.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ll turn now to the benefits which have resulted from the introduction of these
            new greenhouses. These benefits are of various kinds, but for now I’ll just mention the social
            benefits.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First of all, people who own a greenhouse gain social standing in their
            communities, because they provide vegetables for the wider community, for regular consumption as well as for
            festivals, and they also earn income. Secondly, because in rural areas it is <span
                class="explainq10 explain">women</span> who usually grow the food, the greenhouses have increased their
            opportunities. They bring the benefits of improved nutrition, and increased family income, from the sale of
            surplus produce. And thirdly, as a result of their improved financial position, some families can now afford
            to educate their children for the first time.</span></p>
