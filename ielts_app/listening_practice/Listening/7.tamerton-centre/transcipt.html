  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leader: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Hello
      everyone. I’ve been asked to talk to you this afternoon about next month’s trip to&nbsp;</span><span
      style="font-weight: 400;">Tamerton Study Centre for the two-week course. Now some of the things I’m going say you
      may have already heard or read about ... but I think it’s important to emphasise a few key points.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First of all, it’s worth reminding you why Tamerton was set up in the first place
      ... in the late nineteen sixties. That was really before all the concern with preserving the environment which
      everyone talks about these days. <span class="explainq1 explain">The idea was simply to get people out of the
        cities and into the country and to find out that just being outdoors can be very rewarding.</span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not going to be a holiday in the usual sense. It’s called an adventure
      course because you’ll really be stretched to your limits but that in itself can be a positive thing. The group I
      took last year, for example, said that although they actually felt pretty weak and exhausted all the time, <span
        class="explainq2 explain">it really made them learn a lot about themselves and increased their confidence</span>
      ... and in the end that’s the most important thing.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now all of you knew about policies at Tamerton before you signed up for it, so you
      know that in many ways it’s quite old fashioned - you don’t have a lot of choice in what you do. But <span
        class="explainq3 explain">something which I think makes the place so special is that you get to try so many
        different things, every day</span>. For instance, one day you’ll do climbing and the next you’ll be surveying
      rock pools. It’s not intended that you become an expert in any of them ... it’s more like a taster, which you can
      follow up if you want.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And there isn’t a lot of free time ... organised activities and talks, etc. go on
      until nine p.m. and lights go out at eleven p.m. There are table tennis tables, with all the equipment, and <span
        class="explainq4 explain">board games, though I have to say the pieces often go missing so it’s a good idea to
        take your own.</span> There’s a DVD player with a good selection of films suitable for this age group so don’t
      take yours.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bed-time at eleven p.m. is strictly enforced ... and there’s a good reason for
      this. <span class="explainq5 explain">You’re all under eighteen and we organisers need to know that all group
        members are accounted for in the house as we close for the night.</span> And of course you’ll be so exhausted
      anyway that you’ll be too sleepy to want to cause any trouble.</span>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leader: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Now,
      what should you pack? The information sheet tells you a lot about what clothing to&nbsp;</span><span
      style="font-weight: 400;">bring ... but what about other things? Well, Tamerton House has its own small shop, but
      anything bigger is several miles away so you won’t have many opportunities for buying supplies. So in this last
      part of my talk, I’m going to explain what objects you should take with you to the Centre, what you can take if
      you want and also, very importantly, what you cannot take.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several of you came up to me before this talk and asked <span
        class="explainq6 explain">whether you can take things like kettles, or hairdryers</span>. The answer is, there
      are ple</span>nty of these electrical appliances available&nbsp;in the Centre and they are of the proper voltage
    and are checked regularly. Yours may not be, so the rules at Tamerton say you can’t bring them into the Centre ...
    because it’s considered a fire risk ... remember it’s a very <span style="font-weight: 400;">old house. Now, another
      question was about <span class="explainq7 explain">cell phones.</span> Although you definitely can’t have them on
      during inside talks, you equally definitely need them when you’re ou</span>t on exercises ... so they’re a must,
    I’m afraid. Anybody who wishes to talk to me about borrowing a phone for the fortnight, please see me after this
    talk.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, the weather’s heating up at the moment and you’ll be outdoors a great deal. If
      you wear proper clothing, especially a hat, <span class="explainq8 explain">sun cream is optional</span>. Also
      they sell high-factor cream in the shop so you don’t have to take any of your own, unless there’s a special kind
      you use. Now there’s a special note about things like <span class="explainq9 explain">deodorants which come in
        aerosol cans - I need to tell you that these are banned in the Centre</span> because apparently they have the
      habit of setting off the fire alarms. If you want to take an aerosol can, you’ll actually be at risk of being told
      to leave.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And finally, people having been asking about whether they need to take <span
        class="explainq10 explain">towels</span>. Well, the Centre does provide one towel per guest, which you’re
      required to was</span>h yourself. If you’re happy with that then don’t bring another. If not, take one of your
    own. Just remember how much outdoor exercise you’ll be doing ... and how dirty and wet you’ll be getting ...</p>
