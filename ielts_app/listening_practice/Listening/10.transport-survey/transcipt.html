    </div>
    <p>Excuse me.</p>
    <p>Yes?</p>
    <p>I wonder if you could spare a few minutes to do a survey on transport.</p>
    <p>It won't take long.</p>
    <p>No, that’s fine.</p>
    <p>Lovely. The survey is on behalf of the local council. They’d like to know about what transport you use and any
        suggestions for improvement.</p>
    <p>Can I start by asking you how you travelled to town today?</p>
    <p>Sure. I came on the bus.</p>
    <p>Great. Now can I get a few details about yourself?</p>
    <p>OK.</p>
    <p>What’s your name?</p>
    <p>It’s Luisa ....</p>
    <p>Yes.</p>
    <p><span class="explainq1 explain">Hardie.</span></p>
    <p>Can you spell that, please?</p>
    <p>Yes, it’s H-A-R-D-l-E.</p>
    <p>Great. Thanks. And can I have your address?</p>
    <p>It’s <span class="explainq2 explain">19</span>, White Stone Road.</p>
    <p>Oh, right'. I know that area. It’s Bradfield, isn’t it?</p>
    <p>That’s right.</p>
    <p>Is the postcode GT7?</p>
    <p>It’s actually <span class="explainq3 explain">G-T-8. 2-L-C</span>.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Great. And could I ask what your job is? Are you a student?</p>
    <p>I’ve actually just finished my training.&nbsp;<span class="explainq4 explain">I'm a hairdresser</span>.</p>
    <p>Oh, right. And one more question in this section. What is the reason for you coming into town today?</p>
    <p>Actually it’s not for shopping today, which would be my normal reason, <span class="explainq5 explain">but to see
            the dentist</span>.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Right. Thanks.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Now in this last section I’d like you to give us some ideas about the facilities and arrangements in the city for
        getting to and from work, er, any suggestions you have for improvements.</p>
    <p>Well, something I’ve thought about for some time is that when I do walk and I’m doing a later shift, <span
            class="explainq6 explain">I think the lighting should be better</span>.</p>
    <p>Yes, good point.</p>
    <p>And of course, I think it’s a real shame they’ve been cutting down on the number of footpaths. They should have
        more of those. Then people would walk more.</p>
    <p>Yes, right.</p>
    <p>And, <span class="explainq7 explain">I don’t think there are enough trains. That’s why&nbsp;I don’t use them -
            you have to wait so long</span>.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Thanks. And finally I’d like to ask your opinion on cycling. As you may know, there’s a drive in the city to get
        more people to cycle to work.</p>
    <p>Right.</p>
    <p>But we realise that there are things which the council, but also employers, might do to help encourage workers to
        cycle to work.</p>
    <p>Yep. Well, I have thought about it and where I work <span class="explainq8 explain">there are no safe places to
            leave your bikes</span>.</p>
    <p>OK.</p>
    <p>And also, I’d have to cycle uphill and on a hot day I’d arrive at work pretty sweaty so <span
            class="explainq9 explain">I think I’d need a shower somewhere at work</span>.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Right.</p>
    <p>And I suppose the last thing is that <span class="explainq10 explain">I wouldn’t be all that confident about
            cycling on such busy roads. I think I'd like to see you offering training for that</span>, you know, I’d
        feel a lot better about starting if that was the case.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Well, that’s very helpful. Thank you very much for your time.</p>
    <p>No problem. Bye.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
