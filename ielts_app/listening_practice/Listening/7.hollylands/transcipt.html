  <p><span class="font5" style="font-weight: bold;">Guide:&nbsp;</span><span class="font5"><span class="font5">It's nice
        to see so many of you here. I'm going to tell you something about&nbsp;Hollylands&nbsp;- our facilities and
        activities, and the exhibitions we&nbsp;have coming up. I hope you'll find it interesting and bring your
        pupils&nbsp;along. For most of what we have to offer here, you can just turn up&nbsp;with your party. I'm
        pleased to say that recent work has meant that&nbsp;the whole centre is prepared for&nbsp;<span
          style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">blind visitors (D)</span>. There are&nbsp;<span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">a couple of&nbsp;activities where we ask you to <span
            style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;">book a week in advance</span></span>. We only
        have&nbsp;</span></span><span class="explainq1 explain">artists that you can watch painting (C)</span><span
      class="font5"><span class="font5">&nbsp;at&nbsp;certain times, so </span></span><span style="color: #0000ff;">we
      need notice&nbsp;of your coming for that</span>.</p>
  <p><span class="font5" style="text-decoration: underline;">The other activity </span><span
      style="color: #0000ff;">requiring at least 7 days' notice</span> is <span class="explainq1 explain">the&nbsp;drama
      workshop&nbsp;(A)</span> <span class="font5">- again, it's a question of organising the staff at&nbsp;this end.
      But the <span style="color: #ff0000;">video you work yourself (E),</span> and so <em><span
          style="color: #ff0000;">that's available&nbsp;any time</span></em>. Another activity where you need to think
      ahead is the&nbsp;<span style="color: #ff0000;">garden sculpture experience (B)</span>, but that's a question of
      the weather,&nbsp;which of course <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>we can't control</em></span>. </span></p>
  <div style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid black; background-color: #dddddd;"><span
      class="font5"><strong><em>Notes</em></strong>:&nbsp;All the activities are mentioned, but only two require booking
      in advance: '<strong>We need notice of your coming for that</strong>'&nbsp;(option <strong>C</strong>) and
      '<strong>requiring at least 7 days' notice</strong>' (option <strong>A</strong>).</span></div>
  <p><span class="font5">Speaking of weather, we run a&nbsp;<span style="color: #0000ff;">reduced range of
        facilities</span> in the <span style="color: #0000ff;">winter months.</span> While the <span
        style="color: #ff0000;">cafe&nbsp;(C)</span> and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">shop&nbsp;(E)</span> provide
      welcome <span style="color: #ff0000;">shelter from the cold and rain</span>, I'm&nbsp;afraid </span><span
      class="font5" style="text-decoration: underline;">our <span class="explainq2 explain">artist in residence scheme
        (B)</span> <span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;">isn't run in the winter, so the&nbsp;studio
        is closed then</span></span><span class="font5">. And </span><span class="font5"
      style="text-decoration: underline;">the animals in </span><span class="explainq2 explain">the mini zoo
      (D)</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration: underline;"> are kept&nbsp;indoors for warmth <span
        style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;">during the cold months, so that doesn't&nbsp;operate
        either</span></span><span class="font5">. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">adventure playground (A)</span>
      <span style="color: #ff0000;">does</span> - though make&nbsp;sure the children are wrapped up well!</span></p>
  <div style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid black; background-color: #dddddd;"><span class="font5"><span
        class="font5"><strong><em>Note</em>:</strong>&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">All the facilities are mentioned,
        but only two are closed in the winter: '<strong>isn't run in the winter, so the studio is
          closed&nbsp;then</strong>' (option <strong>B</strong>) and '<strong>during the cold months, so that
          doesn't&nbsp;operate</strong>' (option <strong>D</strong>).</span></span></div>
  <p><span class="font5"><span class="font5">OK, now we run a programme of exhibitions through the year, so I'll tell
        you about the next few. Our current exhibition,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">Local&nbsp;Lives,</span><span
        class="font5">&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">ends on&nbsp;<span style="color: #ff0000;">26th August</span>,
        and then one called&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="color: #0000ff;">History in&nbsp;Pictures</span><span
        class="font5">&nbsp;</span><span class="font5"><span
          style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>starts</strong></span>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<span
          class="explainq3 explain">28<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;August</span>. This includes all sorts of&nbsp;objects and
        experiences from the past, such as farm machinery&nbsp;and some cars. We're sure children will
        love&nbsp;<strong>the chance to have&nbsp;a ride on an old bus</strong>.</span></span></p>
  <div style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid black; background-color: #dddddd;"><span class="font5"><span
        class="font5"><span class="font5"><strong>Note</strong>:&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">The other date
          mentioned, <span style="color: #ff0000;">26" August</span>, is when the current exhibition <span

  <div style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid black; background-color: #dddddd;"><span class="font5"><span
        class="font5"><strong>Note</strong>:&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">The answer is introduced: '<span

        table's heading&nbsp;'<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Exhibition</strong></span>'. <strong>Three
          words</strong> are allowed, so you must write <strong>the&nbsp;full title</strong>.</span></span></div>
  <p><span class="font5">There will be <span style="color: #ff0000;">pictures</span> and <span
        style="color: #ff0000;">videos</span> depicting all&nbsp;sorts of jobs, from <span style="color: #ff0000;">coal
        mining</span> to <span style="color: #ff0000;">flying planes</span>. And there's a&nbsp;</span><span
      class="font5 explainq5 explain" style="text-decoration: underline;">careers advice</span><span class="font5"><span
        style="color: #0000ff;"> service</span> available for everyone to consult.</span></p>

  <p><span class="font5"> Following&nbsp;on from that show, we're putting on an exhibition called </span><span

  <p><span class="font5">This starts on <span style="color: #0000ff;">11th November</span> and includes hundreds
      of&nbsp;aerial <span style="color: #ff0000;">photographs</span>. A competition accompanies the show, with&nbsp;the

      style="text-decoration: underline;">balloon trip</span><span class="font5"> for two. So, we hope to see

      are mentioned, but not as a <span style="color: #0000ff;">prize</span> for the competition.</span>&nbsp;</div>
  <p><span class="font5">Now, the area occupied by Hollylands is rather large, and we don't want people to get lost, so
      I'll just give you a few pointers to help&nbsp;you orientate yourselves. So, whether you come by car or
      bicycle,&nbsp;you'll come in from the road. Cars then park to the left, through&nbsp;the gates into the car park,
      and <em><span style="color: #ff0000;">bikes (A)</span></em>&nbsp;to the right, through the&nbsp;gates opposite.
      Cyclists in particular might be feeling thirsty at&nbsp;this point, and you can get </span><span
      class="font5 explainq8 explain" style="text-decoration: underline;">a drink from the machine at the end
      of&nbsp;the bike park, halfway to the museum entrance</span><span class="font5">.</span></p>

    <p><span class="font5"><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">You hear about 'a drink from a
        machine', and you hear that this is '<strong>halfway to the museum entrance</strong>'. <strong>B</strong> must
        be the&nbsp;answer for <strong>Question 8.</strong> There is also information about&nbsp;option A, which could
        help you, although the answer doesn't&nbsp;depend on this.</span></p>
  </div>
  <p><span class="font5">You can enjoy&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">your drink in the picnic area, which is opposite
      the car park. For </span><span class="font5" style="font-style: italic;">anyone who doesn't have a</span><span
      class="font5"> mobile </span><span class="font5" style="font-style: italic;">phone, </span><span class="font5"

  <p><span class="font5">Over at the opposite end of the&nbsp;picnic area, across the path, are the <span

        location&nbsp;is described just before the thing is mentioned, so it's&nbsp;important to keep following the

  <p><span class="font5">If you have any queries, please go to the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>manager's
          offic</em><em>e (D)</em></span>,&nbsp;which is behind the picnic area. And, last but not least, you'll
      need&nbsp;to buy your <span style="color: #ff0000;">tickets</span> or show your group pass to the <span
        style="color: #ff0000;"><em>ticket office (F)</em> </span>on&nbsp;the left of the museum entrance. OK, I'll
      pause there - are there&nbsp;any questions at this point?</span></p>
