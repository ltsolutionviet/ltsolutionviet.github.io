    <p>Right, well, for our presentation shall I start with the early life of Thor&nbsp;Heyerdahl?</p>
    <p>Sure. Why don’t you begin with describing the type of boy he was,&nbsp;especially <span
            class="explainq1 explain">&nbsp;his passion for collecting things.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>That’s right, he had his own little museum. And I think it’s unusual for&nbsp;children to develop their own
        values and not join in their parents’ hobbies;</p>
    <p>I’m thinking of how Heyerdahl wouldn’t go hunting with his dad, for example.</p>
    <p>Yeah, he preferred to learn about nature by listening to his mother read to&nbsp;him. And quite early on he knew
        he wanted to become an explorer when he grew up. That came from his camping trips he went on in Norway I
        think...</p>
    <p><span class="explainq2 explain">No,&nbsp;&nbsp;it was climbing that he spent his time on as a young
            man.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>Oh, right... After university he married a classmate and together, &nbsp; they decided to experience living <span
            class="explainq3 explain">on a small island</span>, to find out how<span class="explainq4 explain"> harsh
            weather</span> conditions shaped people’s lifestyles.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>As part of their preparation before they left home, they learnt basic&nbsp;survival skills like building a
        shelter. I guess they needed that knowledge in order to live wild in a remote location with few inhabitants, cut
        off by the sea, which is whatthey were aiming to do.</p>
    <p>An important part of your talk should be the radical theory Heyerdahl&nbsp;formed from examining mysterious
        ancient carvings that he happened to find on the island. I think you should finish with that.</p>
    <p>OK.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>All right, Victor, so after your part I’ll talk about Thor Heyerdahl’s adult life,&nbsp;continuing from the
        theory he had about Polynesian migration. Up until that time of course, academics had believed that humans first
        migrated to the islands in Polynesia from Asia, in the west.</p>
    <p>Yes,<span class="explainq5 explain">they thought that travel from the east was impossible, because of the huge,
            empty stretch of ocean that lies between the islands and the nearest inhabited land.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>Yes, but Heyerdahl spent ages studying the cloud movements, ocean&nbsp;currents and wind patterns to find if it
        was actually possible. And another communities lying to the east of Polynesia. But Heyerdahl knew they made lots
        of coastal voyages in locally built canoes.</p>
    <p>Yes, or sailing on rafts, as was shown by the long voyage that Heyerdahl</p>
    <p>did next. It was an incredibly risky journey to undertake - sometimes I wonder if he did that trip for private
        reasons, you know? To show others that he could have spectacular adventures. What do you think, Olivia?</p>
    <p>Well, <span class="explainq6 explain">I think it was more a matter of simply trying out his idea, to see if
            migration from the east was possible.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>Yes, that's probably it. And the poor guy suffered a bit at that time&nbsp;because the war forced him to stop his
        work for some years ...</p>
    <p>Yes. When he got started again and planned his epic voyage, do you think&nbsp;it was important to him that he
        achieve it-before anyone else did?</p>
    <p>Urn, I haven’t read anywhere that that was his motivation. <span class="explainq7 explain">The most important
            factor seems to have been that he use only ancient techniques and local materials to build his
            raft.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>Yes. I wonder how fast it went.</p>
    <p>Well, it took them 97 days from South America to the Pacific Islands.</p>
    <p>Mm. And after that, Heyerdahl went to Easter Island, didn't he? We should&nbsp;mention the purpose of that trip.
        I think he sailed there in a boat made out of reeds.</p>
    <p>No, that was later on in Egypt, Olivia.</p>
    <p>Oh, yes, that’s right.</p>
    <p>But what he wanted to do was <span class="explainq8 explain">talk to the local people about their old stone
            carvings and then make one himself to learn more about the process.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>I see. Well, what a great life. Even though many of his theories have</p>
    <p>been disproven, he certainly left a lasting impression on many disciplines, didn’t he? <span
            class="explainq9 explain">To my mind, he was the first person to establish what modern academics call
            practical archaeology. I mean, that they try to recreate something from the past today</span>, like he did
        with his raft trip. It’s unfortunate that his ideas about where Polynesians originated from have been completely
        discredited.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Yes. Right, well, I'll prepare a PowerPoint slide at the end that&nbsp;acknowledges our sources. I mainly used
        The Life and Work of Thor Heyerdahl by William Oliver. I thought the research methods he used were very
        sound,<span class="explainq10 explain"> although I must say I found the overall tone somewhat old-fashioned. I
            think they need to do a new, revised edition.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>Yeah, I agree. What about the subject matter - I found it really challenging!</p>
    <p>Well, it's a complex issue ...</p>
    <p>I thought the book had lots of good points. What did you think of...</p>
