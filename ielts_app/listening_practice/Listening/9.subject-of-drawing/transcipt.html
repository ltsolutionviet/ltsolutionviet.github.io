  <p>JEREMY:&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Hello, Helen. Sorry I’m late.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>Hi, Jeremy, no problem. Well we’d better work out where we are on our project, I suppose.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>JEREMY:</p>
  <p>Yeah. I’ve looked at the drawings you’ve done for my story, 'The Forest', and I think they’re brilliant - they
    really create the atmosphere I had in mind when I was writing&nbsp;it.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>I’m glad you like them.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>JEREMY:</p>
  <p>There are just a few suggestions I’d like to make.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>Go ahead.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>JEREMY:</p>
  <p>Now, I’m not sure about the drawing of the <span class="explainq1 explain">cave</span> - it’s got trees all around
    it. which is great, but the drawing’s a bit too static, isn’t it? I think it needs some action.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>Yes, there’s nothing happening. Perhaps l should add the boy - Malcolm, isn't it? He would be walking up to it.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>JEREMY:</p>
  <p>Yes. let’s have Malcolm in the drawing. And what about putting in a <span class="explainq2 explain">tiger</span> -
    the one that he makes friends with a bit later? Maybe it could be sitting under a tree washing&nbsp;itself.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>And the tiger stops in the middle of what it’s doing when it sees Malcolm walking past.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>JEREMY:</p>
  <p>That’s a good idea.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>OK, I’ll have a go at that.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>JEREMY:</p>
  <p>Then there’s the drawing of the crowd of men and women <span class="explainq3 explain">dancing</span>. They're just
    outside the forest, and there’s a lot going&nbsp;on.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>That’s right, you wanted them to be watching a carnival procession, but I thought it would be too crowded. Do you
    think it works like this?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>JEREMY:</p>
  <p>Yes, I like what you’ve done. The only thing is, could you add Malcolm to it, without changing what’s already
    there.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>What about having him sitting on the tree trunk on the right of the picture?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>JEREMY:</p>
  <p>Yes, that would be fine.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>And do you want him watching the other people?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>JEREMY:</p>
  <p>No, he's been left out of all the fun. so I’d like him to be <span class="explainq4 explain">crying</span> -
    that’ll contrast nicely with the next picture, where he's laughing at the clowns in the carnival.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>Right, I’ll do that.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>JEREMY:</p>
  <p>And then the drawing of the people ice skating in the forest.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>I wasn’t too happy with that one. Because they’re supposed to be skating on <span
      class="explainq5 explain">grass</span>, aren’t they?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>JEREMY:</p>
  <p>That’s right, and it’s frozen over. At the moment it doesn’t look quite right.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>Mm, I see what you mean. I'll have another go at that.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>JEREMY:</p>
  <p>And I like the wool hats they're wearing. May be you could give each of them a <span
      class="explainq6 explain">scarf</span>, as well.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>Yeah, that’s easy enough. They can be streaming out behind the people to suggest they’re skating really fast.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>JEREMY:</p>
  <p>Mm, great. Well that’s all on the drawings.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>Right. So you’ve finished writing your story and I just need to finish illustrating it, and my story and your
    drawings are done.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>So the next thing is to decide what exactly we need to write about in the report that goes with the stories, and
    how we’re going to divide the work.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>JEREMY:</p>
  <p>Right, Helen.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>What do you think about including a section on how we planned the project as a whole, Jeremy? That's probably quite
    important.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>JEREMY:</p>
  <p>Yeah. Well, <span class="explainq7 explain">you’ve had most of the good ideas so far. How do you feel about
      drafting something</span>, then we can go through it together and discuss it?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>OK, that seems reasonable. And I could include something on how we came up with the ideas for our two stories,
    couldn’t I?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>JEREMY:</p>
  <p><span class="explainq8 explain">Well I've started writing something about that, so why don’t you do the same and we
      can include the two things.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>Right. So what about our interpretation of the stories? Do we need to write about what we think they show, like the
    value of helping other people, all that sort of thing?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>JEREMY:</p>
  <p>That’s going to come up later, isn’t it? <span class="explainq9 explain">I think everyone in the class is going to
      read each other’s stories and come up with their own interpretations, which we're going to&nbsp;discuss.</span>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>Oh, I missed that. So it isn’t going to be part of the report at all?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>JEREMY:</p>
  <p>No. But we need to write about the illustrations, because they’re an essential element of children’s experience of
    reading the stories. It’s probably easiest for you&nbsp;to write that section, as you know more about drawing than I
    do.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>Maybe, but I find it quite hard to write about.<span class="explainq10 explain"> I’d be happier if you did
      it.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>JEREMY:</p>
  <p>OK. So when do you think ...</p>
