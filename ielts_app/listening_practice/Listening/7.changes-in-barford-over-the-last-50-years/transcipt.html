  <p>MAN:</p>
  <p>First of all, let me thank you all for coming to this public meeting, to discuss the future of our town. Our first
    speaker is Shona Ferguson, from Barford town council. Shona.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>SHONA:</p>
  <p>Thank you. First I’ll briefly give you some background information, then I’ll be asking you for your comments on
    developments in the town.</p>
  <p>Well, as you don’t need me to tell you, Barford has changed a great deal in the last 50 years. These are some of
    the main changes.</p>
  <p>Fifty years ago, buses linked virtually every part of the town and the neighbouring towns and villages. Most people
    used them frequently, but not now, because the bus companies concentrate on just the routes that attract most
    passengers. <span class="explainq1 explain">So parts of the town are no longer&nbsp;served by buses</span>. Even
    replacing old uncomfortable buses with smart new ones has had little&nbsp;impact on passenger numbers. It’s
    sometimes said that bus fares are too high, but in relation to&nbsp;average incomes, fares are not much higher than
    they were 50 years ago.</p>
  <p>Changes in the road network are affecting the town. The centre was recently closed to traffic on a trial basis,
    making it much safer for pedestrians. The impact of this is being measured.<span class="explainq2 explain"> The new
      cycle paths separating bikes from cars in most main roads, are being used far more than&nbsp;was expected,
      reducing traffic and improving air quality</span>. And although the council’s attempts to&nbsp;have a bypass
    constructed have failed, we haven’t given up hope of persuading the government&nbsp;to change its mind.</p>
  <p>Shopping in the town centre has changed over the years. Many of us can remember when the town was crowded with
    people going shopping. Numbers have been falling for several years,&nbsp;despite efforts to attract shoppers, for
    instance by opening new car parks. Some people combine shopping with visits to the town’s restaurants and cafés.
    Most shops are small independent stores, which is good, but many people prefer to use supermarkets&nbsp;and
    department stores in nearby large towns, as there are so <span class="explainq3 explain">few well-known
      chain&nbsp;stores</span> here.</p>
  <p>Turning now to medical facilities, the town is served by family doctors in several medical practices - fewer than
    50 years ago, but each catering for far more patients.</p>
  <p><span class="explainq4 explain">Our hospital closed 15 years ago</span>. which means journeys to other towns are
    unavoidable. On the other hand, there are more dentists than there used to be.</p>
  <p>Employment patterns have changed, along with almost everything else. The number of <span
      class="explainq5 explain">schools and colleges</span> has increased, making that the main employment
    sector.&nbsp;Services, such as website design and accountancy, have grown in importance, and&nbsp;surprisingly,
    perhaps, manufacturing hasn’t seen the decline that has affected it in&nbsp;other parts of the country.</p>
  <p>Now I’ll very quickly outline current plans for some of the town’s facilities, before asking for your comments.</p>
  <p>As you’ll know if you regularly use the car park at the railway station, it’s usually full. The railway company
    applied for permission to replace it with a multi-storey car park, but that was refused. Instead, the company has
    bought some adjoining land, and this will be used to <span class="explainq6 explain">increase the number of parking
      spaces</span>.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span class="explainq7 explain">The Grand, the old cinema in the high street, will close at the end of the year.
      and reopen on a different site</span>. You’ve probably seen the building under construction.&nbsp;The plan is to
    have three screens with fewer seats, rather than just the one large&nbsp;auditorium in the old cinema.</p>
  <p>I expect many of you shop in the <strong>indoor market</strong>. It’s become more and more shabby-looking, and
    because of fears about safety, it was threatened with demolition. The good news is that it will <span
      class="explainq8 explain">close for six weeks to be made safe and redecorated</span>, and&nbsp;the improved
    building will open in July.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Lots of people use the <strong>library</strong>, including school and college students who go there to study. The
    council has managed to secure funding to keep <span class="explainq9 explain">the library open later into&nbsp;the
      evening, twice a week</span>. We would like to enlarge the building in the not-too-distant&nbsp;future, but this
    is by no means definite.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There’s no limit on access to the <strong>nature reserve</strong> on the edge of town, and this will continue to be
    the case. What will change, though, is that the council will no longer be in charge of the area. Instead it will
    become the responsibility of a national body that <span class="explainq10 explain">administers most nature reserves
      in the country</span>.</p>
  <p>OK, now let me ask you ...&nbsp;</p>
