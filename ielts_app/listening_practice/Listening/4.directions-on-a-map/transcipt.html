  <p><span class="explainq1 explain">Speaker 1</span>: Oh, you want the south side of the campus, and where we are now
    at the dance studio is the north end. The best thing is to take the footpath from here to the&nbsp;road. The labs
    will be right in front of you when you get there. Then go to the crossroads and turn left and go down to the lecture
    theatre. Then at the junction at the end of that road, you’ll see a footpath leading to the block.</p>
  <p><span class="explainq2 explain">Speaker 2</span>: We’re right next to the admin block, so ...you see the footpath
    that goes round the side of the lake? Well, go north along that path and then ... you see where it divides? Well,
    you need to take the left fork. You’ll see the supermarket on your left. The footpath will join the road and then if
    you turn right, the block will be just along there on your left.</p>
  <p><span class="explainq3 explain">Speaker 3</span>: I’m afraid you’ve come to the wrong place.</p>
  <p>These are the Graphic Design workshops. Um ... what I suggest is that you take the footpath at the back of the
    workshops, which leads down to the road that you want. Turn right when you get there and follow that road ... go
    straight across both junctions and just keep going. You’ll see the block on your left.</p>
