  <p>CLERK: Good morning, ma’am, and welcome to “Australia’s Moving Experience”! How can I help you?<br>WOMAN: Well,
    I... I hope you can help me. I’m so up in the air right now... I...<br>CLERK: Just calm down, now. Let me guess:
    you’re moving and it has you a little confused.<br>WOMAN: That’s it exactly. You see, I’m relocating to the United
    States next month and I’m having a hard time getting organised.<br>CLERK: Here, fill out your name and address, and
    let me ask you a few questions. Oh, what should I call you?<br>WOMAN: My name is Jane, <span
      class="explainqe explain">Jane Bond</span>.&nbsp;<br>CLERK: OK, Jane, first of all, what’s your work phone number?
    In case I have any questions about things.<br>WOMAN: My work phone is <span
      class="explainq1 explain">94635550</span>. But please try not to call me&nbsp;too often there. My boss hates
    personal calls.<br>CLERK: So does mine, ma’am, so does mine. And what address should we ship your things
    to?<br>WOMAN: My new company is letting me stay temporarily at 509 <span class="explainq2 explain">Clark
      House</span>, that’s C-L-A-R-K, 1137 <span class="explainq3 explain">University Drive</span> in Seattle.<br>CLERK:
    Seattle? Beautiful city, I hear. Mountains right beside the ocean, almost. Cooler than Australia, too. OK, and when
    should we come pack your things?<br>WOMAN: I guess that would be on <span class="explainq4 explain">Monday</span>,
    March 11th.<br><br>Do you want any help with an after-packing clean-up? We do that for a small additional
    charge.<br>Yes, that would be helpful. I promised the landlord I’d give her the keys back by 5:00 p.m. on <span
      class="explainq5 explain">Thursday</span>, the 14th.&nbsp;<br>Great, we’ll just schedule the clean-up for that
    day. That way, the place will smell clean and there’ll be no dust.<br>Well, you do think of everything! Oh, how much
    is this going to cost?<br>Here is a list of our basic prices.<br>Oh dear, this seems rather expensive!<br>Yes ma’am,
    but you’re paying for the best. We’re careful and we’re fast. Like we say, the only thing we break are speed records
    getting you moved.<br>Well... maybe that’s so... Oh, I nearly forgot to tell you. I don’t want my furniture shipped
    with me. I won't be look­ing for an apartment till after I arrive in America. Would it be possible to put my
    furniture in storage here for <span class="explainq6 explain">a month</span>,&nbsp;then have it sent along
    later?<br>Of course, we do that all the time. A couple of other things.</p>
  <p>Here at "A Moving Experience”, we try to pack your things logically. We don’t just throw stuff in boxes.</p>
  <p>Do you have any special requests? You know, things you want packed in some special place, so you know where to find
    them?<br>Like what?<br>Oh, I don’t know... Things like dishes maybe. Not to be rude, but you look like a lady who
    likes to eat.<br>Ahhh! Yes, I need my dishes and things where I can find them quickly.<br>Great. <span
      class="explainq7 explain">We'll put those dishes and cutlery in what we call the emergency pack</span>. Can you
    think of anything else?<br>Ummm,<span class="explainq8 explain"> I do have an antique tea kettle</span> my
    great-grand­mother gave my mother. I wouldn’t want to lose that. So I guess<span class="explainq8 explain"> you’d
      better put that in storage with the furniture</span>.&nbsp;<br>Grandma’s tea kettle with the furniture, got it!
    Say, how about things like your alarm clock? You don’t want to miss your plane on the big day, right?<br>Well, you
    certainly think of everything! Yes, that’s right. <span class="explainq9 explain">I'll also need my alarm clock
      where I can find it.</span><br>Fine, <span class="explainq9 explain">we’ll put that in your personal
      package</span>. And of course,&nbsp;we'll give you a list of where we pack everything. So, all you’ll have to do
    on Thursday, the 14th is grab your luggage on your way out the door. Um, I couldn’t help noticing the new CD player
    you’re carrying. Is that a Samsung?<br>Why? Yes, it is. One of their best. Cost me nearly a hundred dollars, it
    did!<br>Do you want to take special care of it? I mean it’s brand new.<br>Take care of it, but nothing special.
    <span class="explainq10 explain">You can just put it in&nbsp;storage with the furniture.</span><br>That looks like
    everything we need here. I guess you’re all set.<br>That was certainly quick. Thank you, young man. This has been a
    most moving experience!&nbsp;</p>
