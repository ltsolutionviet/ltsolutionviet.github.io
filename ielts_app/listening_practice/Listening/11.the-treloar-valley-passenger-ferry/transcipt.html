    <h2>The Treloar Valley Passenger Ferry</h2>

      style="max-width: 400px; margin: auto;">

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The valley and estuary of the River Treloar forms an unspoilt, beautiful landscape,
      rich in&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">both wildlife and sites of historic interest. There are many
      ways to explore the area, and public transport links are good. It is possible to leave your car behind, and travel
      by boat, train or bus, with just short walks in-between stops.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Treloar Valley Passenger Ferry runs between villages along the river estuary,
      and provides a link with the train station at Berry, which is about ten minutes’ walk from the riverside village
      of Calton. In the past, the river was the main form of transport in the area, and as in the past, today’s ferry
      service operates according to nature. The river estuary is tidal, and so the ferry timetable differs from day to
      day, according to the times and height of the tide. The ferry is also seasonal, normally running between <span
        class="explainq1 explain">April</span> and September, depending on the weather. A timetable for the whole year
      can be downloaded from the internet by visiting www dot treloarferry dot co dot uk.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you just want to sit and relax, and enjoy the lovely scenery, you can take a
      river cruise to Calton and back from the nearby city of Plymouth. In the past, steam ships brought early tourists
      along the same route - Queen Victoria and her family enjoyed such a trip in eighteen fifty six. The journey is
      quicker these days - the round trip takes between four and five hours, depending on tides and weather. <span
        class="explainq2 explain">If you prefer, you can travel upriver by boat and return to Plymouth by train</span>.
      All cruise boats and trains have wheelchair access. For more information, and for departure times, ring Plymouth
      Boat Cruises on zero one seven, five two eight, two three one zero four.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trains run several times a day throughout the year between Calton and Plymouth,
      with various stops in-between. They are used by both local commuters and tourists who want to enjoy the beautiful
      scenery. <span class="explainq3 explain">The highlight of the journey is crossing the river on the stunning
        viaduct, which was built at the beginning of the twentieth century, and towers one hundred and twenty feet over
        the water</span>. It is unnecessary to book, and tickets can be bought on the train. For information about fares
      and timetables, contact National Rail Enquiries by phone or online.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bus service in the Treloar Valley now connects all train stations and villages
      in the area. Specially for holiday makers, there’s a ‘Rover’ ticket which can be used at weekends and on national
      holidays, and allows unlimited journeys on those days. </span><span class="explainq4 explain">The Rover ticket
      provides great value for money, and is now even cheaper than it was last year</span><span
      style="font-weight: 400;">. An adult ticket costs five pounds fifty a day, Senior Citizens can travel for four
      pounds fifty, and a family ticket for up to five people costs just twelve pounds. Tickets can be bought on the
      bus.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the centre of the Treloar Estuary area is the historic riverside village of
      Calton. The main&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">road comes into the village from the south, and <span
        class="explainq5 explain">for those of you who are arriving by bus, it turns left just before the bridge and
        stops in the lay-by on the left hand side</span>. From there it’s just a short walk to Calton’s various
      attractions. If you’re arriving by car, you have to leave it in the </span><span class="explainq6 explain">main
      car park. Go over the bridge and take the first turning on the right. Then go on&nbsp;until you come to the end of
      that road.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It’s the only place to park in Calton but there’s no charge. If
      you’re interested in local history, there’s a <span class="explainq7 explain">museum</span> in Calton with
      farming, fishing and household implements from the late nineteenth century. As you come in from the south, cross
      the river and go straight on the same road until you reach the end. Also on the subject of history, you can go and
      see the old <span class="explainq8 explain">mill</span> which has recently been <strong>renovated</strong> and
      put</span> back into use. Turn left before you come to the bridge. Then go straight on and then take the first
    turning on the right. Thi<span style="font-weight: 400;">s leads straight there. If you’re interested in arts and
      crafts, there’s a <span class="explainq9 explain">potter’s studio</span> where you can watch the artist at
      w</span>ork. After crossing the bridge turn left and it’s the second building on the left. Fin<span
      style="font-weight: 400;">ally, when you feel in need of refreshments, there’s a <span
        class="explainq10 explain">cafe opposite the old boat house</span>, and a picnic area near the mill.</span></p>
