  <p>Welcome to the Fiddy Working Heritage Farm. This open-air museum gives you the experience of agriculture and rural
    life in the English countryside at the end of the nineteenth&nbsp;century. So you’ll see a typical farm of that
    period, and like me, all the staff are dressed in&nbsp;clothes of that time.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I must give you some advice and safety tips before we go any further. As it’s a working farm, please don’t frighten
    or injure the<span class="explainq1 explain"> animals</span>. We have a lot here, and many of them are
    breeds&nbsp;that are now quite rare.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>And do stay at a safe distance from the <span class="explainq2 explain">tools</span>: some of them have sharp
    points which can be pretty dangerous. so please don’t touch them. We don’t want any accidents, do we?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The around is very uneven, and you might slip if you're wearing sandals so I'm glad to see you're all wearing <span
      class="explainq3 explain">shoes</span> - we always advise people to do that.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Now, children of all ages are very welcome here, and usually even very young children love the ducks and lambs, so
    do bring them along next time you come.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I don’t think any of you have brought <span class="explainq4 explain">dogs</span> with you. but in case you have.
    I’m afraid they'll have to stay in the car park, unless they’re guide dogs. I’m sure you’ll understand that
    they&nbsp;could cause a lot of problems on a farm.</p>

          <p>Now let me give you some idea of the layout of the farm. The building where you bought your tickets is the
            New Barn, immediately to your right, and we’re now at the beginning of the main&nbsp;path to the farmland -
            and of course the car park is on your left. <span class="explainq5 explain">The scarecrow you can
              see&nbsp;in the car park in the corner, beside the main path</span>, is a traditional figure for keeping
            the birds away from crops, but our scarecrow is a permanent sculpture. It’s taller than a human being, so
            you can see it from quite a distance.</p>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <p><span class="explainq6 explain">If you look ahead of you. you’ll see a maze. It’s opposite the New Barn,
              beside the side path that branches off to the right just over there.</span> The maze is made out of hedges
            which are too&nbsp;tall for young children to see over them, but it’s quite small, so you can’t get lost in
            it!</p>

      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>Now, can you see the bridge crossing the fish pool further up the main path? <span
              class="explainq7 explain">If you want to go to the café, go towards the bridge and turn right just before
              it. Walk along the side path and&nbsp;the cafe’s on the first bend you come to</span>. The building was
            originally the schoolhouse, end it’s&nbsp;well over a hundred years old.</p>
        </td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>As you may know, we run skills workshops here, where you can learn traditional crafts like woodwork and
            basket-making. You can see examples of the work, and talk to someone about&nbsp;the courses, in the Black
            Barn. <span class="explainq8 explain">If you take the side path to the right. here, just by the
              New&nbsp;Barn, you’ll come to the Black Barn just where the path first bends.</span></p>

          <p>Now I mustn’t forget to tell you about picnicking, as I can see some of you have brought your lunch with
            you. You can picnic in the field, though do clear up behind you, of course. <strong><span
                class="explainq9 explain">Or if&nbsp;you’d prefer a covered picnic area, there’s one near the farmyard:
                just after you cross the&nbsp;bridge, there’s a covered picnic spot on the right.</span></strong></p>

        <td>&nbsp;</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>And the last thing to mention is <span class="explainq10 explain">Fiddy House itself. From here you can
              cross the bridge then walk along the footpath through the field to the left of the farmyard. That goes to
              the house,</span>&nbsp;and it’ll give you a lovely view of it. It’s certainly worth a few photographs, but
            as it’s a private&nbsp;home, I’m afraid you can’t go inside.</p>

          <p>Right. Well, if you’re all ready, we’ll set off on our tour of the farm.</p>
