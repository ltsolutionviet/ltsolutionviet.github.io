    <h2>New city developments</h2>

  <p>Good morning. I’m very pleased to have this opportunity to say a little about two exciting new developments in the
    city: the Brackenside Open-Air Swimming Pool and the children’s Adventure Playground in Central Park. As many of you
    may know,&nbsp;<span class="explainq1 explain">the idea for these initiatives came from you, the public</span>, in
    the extensive consultation exercise which the City Council conducted last year. And they have been realised using
    money from the SWRDC - the South West Regional Development Commission.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>First of all, Brackenside Pool. As many of the older members of the audience will remember, there used to be a
    wonderful open-air pool on the sea front 30 years ago but it had to close when it was judged to be unsafe. For the
    design of this new heated pool, we were very happy to secure the talents of internationally renowned architect Ellen
    Wendon, who has managed to combine a charming 1930s design, which fits in so well with many of the other buildings
    in the area, with up-to-the-minute features <span class="explainq2 explain">such as a recycling system - the only
      one of its kind in the world - which enables seawater to be used in the pool.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p><span class="explainq3 explain">Now, there has been quite a bit of discussion in the local press about
      whether</span> there would be enough room for the number of visitors we’re hoping to attract, but the design is
    deceptive and there have been rigorous checks about capacity. Also, just in case you were wondering, we’re on
    schedule for a&nbsp;June 15th opening date and well within budget: a testimony to the excellent work of local
    contractors Hickman’s.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>We hope that as many people as possible will be there on June 15th. We have engaged award-winning actress Coral
    White to declare the pool open and there’ll be drinks and snacks available at the pool side. There'll also be a
    competition for the public to <span class="explainq4 explain">decide on the sculpture we plan to have at the
      entrance: you will decide which famous historical figure from the city we should have.</span></p>
  <p>And now, moving on to the Central Park Playground, which we’re pleased to announce has just won the Douglas Award
    for safety: the news came through only last week. The unique design is based on the concept of the Global Village,
    with the playground being divided into six areas showing different parts of the world - each with a representative
    feature. For example, there is a section on <span class="explainq5 explain">Asia, and this is represented by rides
      and equipment in the shape of snakes, orang-utans, tigers and so on - fauna native to the forests of the
      region.</span></p>
  <p>Moving south to the Antarctic - we couldn’t run to an ice rink I’m afraid but opted instead for <span
      class="explainq6 explain">climbing blocks in the shape of mountains</span>&nbsp;- I thought they could have had
    slides for the &nbsp;glaciers but the designers did want to avoid being too literal! Then on to South America - and
    here<span class="explainq7 explain"> the theme is El Dorado - games replicating the search for mines full of
      precious stones</span>. And then moving up to North America, here there was considerable debate -1 know the
    contribution of cinema and jazz was considered but <span class="explainq8 explain">the designers finally opted for
      rockets and the International Space Station</span>. Eastwards to Europe then, and perhaps the most traditional
    choice of all the areas: <span class="explainq9 explain">medieval castles and other fortifications</span>.
    Then&nbsp;last, but not least, moving south to <span class="explainq10 explain">Africa and a whole set of wonderful
      mosaics to represent the great rivers of this fascinating and varied continent.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p>Now, the opening date for our Global Playground is 10th July. And again we'd love to see you there - so make a date
    and come and see this magnificent, original new amenity right in the heart of the city.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
