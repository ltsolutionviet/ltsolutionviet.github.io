  <p>So how did you get on with your school-based research, Phoebe?</p>
  <p>Well, it was <strong>exhausting</strong> but really valuable.</p>
  <p>Good. What was the specific focus you chose?</p>
  <p>My title is ‘Attitudes towards study among eleven-twelve year-old pupils’.</p>
  <p>Right. And what made you choose that focus?</p>
  <p>Well, that’s a bit difficult ... lots of my classmates decided on their focus really early&nbsp;on.. .mainly on the
    basis of what they thought would help in their future career, you know, in&nbsp;their first year’s teaching.</p>
  <p>So that’s what helped you decide?</p>
  <p>Actually, it was that <span class="explainq1 explain">I came across a book written by experienced teachers on
      student attitudes and that motivated me to go for the topic</span>.</p>
  <p>So what were your research questions or issues?</p>
  <p>Well I wanted to look at <span class="explainq2 explain">the ways students responded to different teachers
      particularly focusing on whether very strict teachers made teenagers less motivated</span>.</p>
  <p>And, from your research, did you find that was true?</p>
  <p>No, not from what I saw you know, from my five days’ observation, talking to people and so forth.</p>
  <p>OK ... We’ll talk about the actual research methods in a moment, but before that, can you briefly summarise what
    your most striking findings are.</p>
  <p>Well, what really amazed me was the significant gender differences, I didn’t set out to focus on that but I found
    that <span class="explainq3 explain">boys were much more positive about being at school ... girls were more
      impatient, they talked a lot about wanting to grow up and leave school</span>.</p>
  <p>Very interesting.</p>
  <p>Yeah ... it is. From doing the research it was clear to me that you might start out to focus on one thing but you
    pick up lots of unexpected insights.</p>
  <p>Right. Did you get any insights into teaching?</p>
  <p>Yes, certainly. I was doing a lot of observations of the way kids with very different abilities collaborate on
    certain tasks, you know, help each other and I began to realise that the lessons were developing in really
    unexpected ways.</p>
  <p>So what conclusion do you draw from that?</p>
  <p>Well, I know <span class="explainq4 explain">it’s necessary for teachers to prepare lessons carefully but it’s
      great if they also allow lessons to go their own ways</span>.</p>
  <p>Good point. Now, I’m really pleased to see you doing this - analysing and drawing conclusions based on data.</p>
  <p>But surely this isn’t proper data ...</p>
  <p>Because it’s derived from such small-scale research? Well, as long as you don’t make grand claims for your
    findings, this data is entirely valid.</p>
  <p>Hmm .</p>
  <p><span class="explainq5 explain">I like the way you’re already stepping back from the experience and thinking about
      what you’ve learned about research ... well done</span>.</p>
  <p>But I know I could have done it better.</p>
  <p>As you become more experienced you’ll find ways to reduce the risk of difficulties.</p>
  <p>OK.</p>
  <p>Tony: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, let’s look in more detail at how you gathered your data.
    Let’s start with <span class="explainq6 explain">lesson&nbsp;</span>observation.</p>
  <p>Phoebe: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, it generally went quite smoothly. I chose my focus and designed my
    checklist. Then&nbsp;teachers allowed me into their classes without any problems, which surprised me. It was
    afterwards that the gruelling work started!</p>
  <p>Tony: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, it’s very time consuming, isn’t it? Making sense
    of...analysing ... your observation&nbsp;notes.</p>
  <p>Phoebe: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Absolutely. Much more so than interview data, for example ... that was relatively
    easy to&nbsp;process, though I wanted to make sure I used <span class="explainq7 explain">a high-quality recorder
      ... to make transcription easier</span> and I had to wait until one became available.</p>
  <p>Tony: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right. And did you interview some kids as well?</p>
  <p>Phoebe: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the end, yes, I talked to ten, and they were great. I’d imagined I’d be bored
    listening to&nbsp;them, but.. .</p>
  <p>Tony: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it was easy to concentrate?</p>
  <p>Phoebe: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure. One of the teachers was a bit worried about the ethics, you know, whether it
    was right&nbsp;to <span class="explainq8 explain">interview young pupils</span>, and it took a while for him to
    agree to let me talk to three of the kids in his class but he relented in the end.</p>
  <p>Tony: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good. What other methods did you use?</p>
  <p>Phoebe: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I experimented with <span class="explainq9 explain">questionnaires</span>, but I
    really regret that now. I decided to share the work&nbsp;with another student but we had such different agendas it
    ended up taking twice as long.</p>
  <p>Tony: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That’s a shame ... it might be worth you reflecting on ways
    you might improve on that for&nbsp;future projects .</p>
  <p>Phoebe: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You’re right, yeah.</p>
  <p>Tony: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OK.</p>
  <p>Phoebe: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the other thing I did was stills <span
      class="explainq10 explain">photography</span>. I didn’t take as many pictures as I’d hoped&nbsp;to .</p>
  <p>Tony: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lack of time?</p>
  <p>Phoebe: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s pretty easy just snapping away ... but I wanted each snap to have a purpose,
    you know,&nbsp;that would contribute to my research aims and I found that difficult.</p>
  <p>Tony: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, that’s understandable, but remember...</p>
