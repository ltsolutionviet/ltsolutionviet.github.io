    <h2>Research on web based crosswords </h2>
    <img src="web.jpg" class="img-responsive"
      style="max-width: 400px; margin: auto;">
  </div>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, the task I gave you both was to choose an article about a small-scale research
      project.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jake: Yes ...</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You were then required to try to reproduce the research procedures in your own
      context ... i.e. try it out for yourselves.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah ... and that’s what we’ve done.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great. So I’d like you to tell me a bit about the article and why you chose
      it.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, the article’s written by two university lecturers who had started using
      crosswords to help their students revise terminology for exams .</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the crosswords were designed and set on computers.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And <span class="explainq1 explain">we selected the article because ... well it
        seemed an accessible topic, even though we weren’t familiar with the technique</span> ... you know ... using IT
      to design crosswords for higher education.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s a good reason. So these lecturers wanted to see how well this innovation was
      received by their students?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jake: Yes.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how did you go about reproducing the research?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, we drew up a list of terms from one of our own modules ... and designed a
      crossword for revising these terms.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then we asked our classmates to try out the crossword and give us feedback, you
      know, their opinions, on how they felt about using the technique.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Was it easy to find participants?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t easy at first. But then <span class="explainq2 explain">we convinced them
        that by taking part in the research they were actually benefiting themselves by preparing for an exam which is
        coming up later this term.</span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leela:
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span
      style="font-weight: 400;">And it worked!</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tutor:
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span
      style="font-weight: 400;">Good. So how did you find out what the students thought about doing the
      crosswords?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jake:
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span
      style="font-weight: 400;">A questionnaire</span>. <span class="explainq3 explain">The original article used a
      two-page long questionnaire. There were lots&nbsp;of excellent questions on it but the whole section on
      difficulties using IT is now obsolete</span> ... old-fashioned even, e<span style="font-weight: 400;">ven though
      it had only been written a couple of years ago.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tutor:
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">So
      you designed a shorter version?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leela:
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span
      style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah. Then we sent it to the forty students by email and got twenty-eight replies. I
      was&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">taken aback by the fact that everybody we talked to thought this
      was a good return! I mean the responses were well written, you know, people had taken a lot of care, but <span
        class="explainq4 explain">I was really disappointed with the low numbers</span>.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tutor:
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span
      style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, an important lesson to learn for an apprentice researcher .</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leela and Jake: Yeah.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tutor:
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">So
      what results did you get?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jake:
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span
      style="font-weight: 400;">Well, basically the responses were extremely positive. The students said that
    </span><span class="explainq5 explain">doing the&nbsp;crossword on a computer helped them really focus on the work
      in hand and not be distracted,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which is something that commonly happens
      with other ways of doing of revision.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah ... that was really clear. But something that struck me was that ‘having fun’
      hardly featured in their responses ... nor did anything to do with spelling of hard words ... which I thought
      would be an obvious benefit.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No? OK ...</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Respondents also said that doing the crossword hadn’t really increased their
      general motivation to study but that <span class="explainq6 explain">it had highlighted the gaps in their memory
        so they knew what further work was necessary</span>.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right ... So how did your findings tally with those of the original
      researchers?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were lots of similarities but ...</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.there were probably two main differences. We found that <span
        class="explainq7 explain">more males than females liked the technique, whereas the original study found the
        reverse</span>.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also our respondents said<span class="explainq8 explain"> they wouldn’t mind doing
        a crossword as a final official exam ... whereas in the original study students said they would hate doing it
        even if it meant having a shorter test</span>.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But of course both sets of respondents said they’d be interested in doing more
      crosswords for informal purposes, revision and so forth.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right, so let’s have a think about the whole project and what you’ve learned from
      doing it. Well ... it was very time consuming!</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah! And I don’t think we managed that aspect very well.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It could have been worse ... I mean we didn’t have a lot of data so we didn’t have
      to spend ages processing it. And of course, we’d already done a course on numerical data processing so there
      wasn’t much new there.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, that’s true. Anyway, I think we designed our questions well so that they gave
      us manageable data.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, it really helped having the original study to guide us, as it were ... and
      <span class="explainq9 explain">that helped us see what a good research instrument is</span> ...</span><span
      style="font-weight: 400;">.what a good questionnaire should be like.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Absolutely - we got a lot from that. But when we were writing up the project, I’m
      not sure whether we’ll know how to acknowledge the work of the original study ... you know, our
      referencing.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No ... that’s something we’ll both have to work on in the future.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually that part’s been great,<span class="explainq10 explain"> finding ways to
        share and support another person</span>.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s the real plus from the project ... learning ways to do that.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, it’s obviously been very successful ...</span></p>
