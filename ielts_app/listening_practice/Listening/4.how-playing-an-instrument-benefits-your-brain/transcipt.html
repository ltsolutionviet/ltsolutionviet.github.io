    <h2>How Playing an Instrument Benefits your Brain</h2>

  <p>Did you know that every time musicians pick up their instruments, there are fireworks going off all over their
    brain? On the outside, they may look calm and focused, reading the music and making the precise and practiced
    movements required. But inside their brains, there's a party going on. How do we know this? Well, in the last few
    decades, neuroscientists have made enormous breakthroughs in understanding how our brains work by monitoring them in
    real time with instruments like fMRI and PET scanners.</p>
  <p>When people are hooked up to these machines, tasks, such as reading or doing math problems, each have corresponding
    areas of the brain where activity can be observed. But when researchers got the participants to listen to music,
    they saw fireworks. Multiple areas of their brains were lighting up at once, as they processed the sound, took it
    apart to understand elements like melody and rhythm, and then put it all back together into unified musical
    experience. And our brains do all this work in the split second between when we first hear the music and when our
    foot starts to tap along.</p>
  <p>But when scientists turned from observing the brains of music listeners to those of musicians, the little backyard
    fireworks became a jubilee. It turns out that while listening to music engages the brain in some pretty interesting
    activities, playing music is the brain's equivalent of a full-body workout. The neuroscientists saw <span
      class="explainq1 explain">multiple areas of the brain light up, simultaneously processing</span> different
    information in intricate, interrelated, and astonishingly fast sequences. But what is it about making music that
    sets the brain alight? The research is still fairly new, but neuroscientists have a pretty good idea.</p>
  <p>Playing a musical instrument engages practically every area of the brain at once, especially the <span
      class="explainq2 explain">visual, auditory, and motor cortices</span>. As with any other workout, disciplined,
    structured practice in playing music strengthens those brain functions, allowing us to apply that strength to other
    activities. The most obvious difference between listening to music and playing it is that the latter requires fine
    motor skills, which are controlled in both hemispheres of the brain.</p>
  <p>It also combines <span class="explainq3 explain">the linguistic and mathematical precision, in which the left
      hemisphere is more involved</span>, with the novel and creative content that the right excels in. For these
    reasons, playing music has been found to increase the volume and activity in the brain's <span
      class="explainq4 explain">corpus callosum</span>, the bridge between the two hemispheres, allowing messages to get
    across the brain faster and through more diverse routes. This may allow musicians to solve problems more effectively
    and creatively, in both academic and social settings. Because making music also involves crafting and understanding
    its emotional content and message, musicians often have higher levels of executive function, a category of
    interlinked tasks that includes planning, strategizing, and attention to detail and requires simultaneous analysis
    of both cognitive and emotional aspects. This ability also has an impact on how our memory systems work. And,
    indeed, musicians exhibit enhanced memory functions, creating, storing, and retrieving memories more quickly and
    efficiently.</p>
  <p>Studies have found that musicians appear to <span class="explainq5 explain">use their highly connected brains to
      give each memory multiple tags</span>, such as a conceptual tag, an emotional tag, an audio tag, and a contextual
    tag, like a good Internet search engine. How do we know that all these benefits are unique to music, as opposed to,
    say, sports or painting? Or could it be that people who go into music were already smarter to begin with?
    Neuroscientists have explored these issues, but so far, they have found that the artistic and aesthetic aspects of
    learning to play a musical instrument are different from any other activity studied, including other arts. And
    several randomized studies of participants, who showed the same levels of cognitive function and neural processing
    at the start, found that <span class="explainq6 explain">those who were exposed to a period of music learning showed
      enhancement in multiple brain areas, compared to the others</span>. This recent research about the mental benefits
    of playing music has advanced our understanding of mental function, revealing the inner rhythms and complex
    interplay that make up the amazing orchestra of our brain.</p>
