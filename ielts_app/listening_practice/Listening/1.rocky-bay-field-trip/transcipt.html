  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>
    I’ve brought my notes on our Biology Field Trip to Rocky Bay, Colin, so we
    can work on our report on the research we did together.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>COLIN:</p>
  <p>OK. I've got mine too. Let’s look at the aims of the trip first.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>Right. What did you have?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>COLIN:</p>
  <p>
    I just put something about getting experience of the different sorts of
    procedures used on a field trip. But
    <span class="explainq1 explain"
      >we need something about what causes different organisms to choose
      particular habitats.</span
    >
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>
    I agree. And something about finding out how to protect organisms in danger
    of dying out?
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>COLIN:</p>
  <p>In our aims? But we weren’t really looking at that.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>
    I suppose not. OK, now there’s the list of equipment we all had to bring on
    the field trip. What did they tell us to bring a ruler for?
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>COLIN:</p>
  <p>
    It was something about measuring the slope of the shore, but of course we
    didn’t need it because we were measuring wind direction, and we’d brought
    the compass&nbsp;for that...
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>
    But not the piece of <span class="explainq2 explain">string</span> to hold
    up in the air! Didn’t Mr Blake make a fuss about us leaving that behind.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>COLIN:</p>
  <p>
    Yeah. He does go on. Anyway it was easy to get one from another of the
    students.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>Now, the next section’s the procedure. I sent you the draft of that.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>COLIN:</p>
  <p>
    Yeah. It was clear, but<span class="explainq3 explain">
      I don’t think we need all these details of what time we left and what time
      we got back and how we divided up the different research tasks.</span
    >
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>OK. I’ll look at that again.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>COLIN:</p>
  <p>
    Then we have to describe our method of investigation in detail. So let’s
    begin with how we measured wave speed. I was surprised how
    <span class="explainq4 explain">straightforward</span> that was.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>
    I’d expected us to have some sort of high-tech device, not just stand there
    and count the number of waves per minute. Not very precise, but I suppose it
    was good&nbsp;enough. But the way we measured the amount of salt was
    interesting.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>COLIN:</p>
  <p>In the water from the rock pools?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>
    Yeah, oh, I wanted to check the chemicals we used in the lab when we
    analysed those samples - was it potassium chromate and silver nitrate?
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>COLIN:</p>
  <p>That’s right.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>
    OK. And we need the map of the seashore. You just left that to me. And I had
    to do it while the tide was low, well that was OK, but
    <span class="explainq5 explain"
      >the place I started it from was down&nbsp;on the beach</span
    >, then I realised I should have gone up higher to get better visibility.
    so&nbsp;I had to start all over again. But at least I’d got the squared
    paper or I’d have had&nbsp;problems drawing it all to scale.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>COLIN:</p>
  <p>
    Yes. It looks good. We could get a map of the region off the internet and
    see if we need to make any changes.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>
    I had a look but I couldn’t find anything. But you took some pictures,
    didn’t you?
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>COLIN:</p>
  <p>Yeah. I’ll email you them if you want.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>
    OK.<span class="explainq6 explain">
      I’ll make my amendments using those, then I can scan it into our
      report</span
    >. Great.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>
    Now when we get to our findings I thought we could divide them up into the
    different zones we identified on the shore and the problems organisms face
    in each zone. So&nbsp;for the highest area ...
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>COLIN:</p>
  <p>... the splash zone?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>
    Yeah, we found mostly those tiny shellfish that have strong hard shells that
    act as protection.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>COLIN:</p>
  <p>But not from other organisms that might eat them, predators?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>
    No, that’s not the main danger for them. But the shells prevent them from
    <span class="explainq7 explain">drying out</span> because they’re in the
    open air for most of the time.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>COLIN:</p>
  <p>
    Right. And since they’re exposed, they need to be able to find some sort of
    shelter, or cover themselves up. so they don’t get
    <span class="explainq8 explain">too hot</span>. Then in the middle and lower
    zones,&nbsp;nearer the sea, we need to discuss the effects of wave action
    ...
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>
    Yes, and how organisms develop structures to prevent themselves from being
    swept away, or even destroyed by being smashed against the rocks.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>COLIN:</p>
  <p>
    I haven’t done anything on the geological changes. I don’t know what to put
    for that.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>
    No, we weren’t concentrating on that. Maybe we need to find some websites.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>COLIN:</p>
  <p>
    Good idea. I’ve got the lecture notes from Mr Blake’s geology course, but
    they’re too general. But we could ask him which books on our Reading List
    might be most&nbsp;helpful.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>
    Right. OK, now I did a draft of the section of sources of possible error in
    our research, but I don’t know if you agree. For example, the size of the
    sample, and&nbsp;whether it’s big enough to make any general conclusions
    from. But I thought actually&nbsp;we did have quite a big sample.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>COLIN:</p>
  <p>
    We did. And our general method of observation seemed quite reliable. But we
    might not be all that accurate as far as the actual numbers go.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>
    Yeah we might have
    <span class="explainq9 explain">missed some organisms</span> - if they were
    hiding under a rock, for example. I wasn’t sure about the way we described
    their habitats. I decided it was&nbsp;probably OK.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>COLIN:</p>
  <p>
    Yeah, and the descriptions we gave of the smaller organisms, they weren’t
    very detailed but they were adequate in this context.
    <span class="explainq10 explain"
      >I'm not sure we identified all the species correctly though</span
    >.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>HELEN:</p>
  <p>OK, we’d better mention that. Now, how ...</p>
