  <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will hear a wildlife expert giving a talk to a group of bird lovers in the
        UK about a species&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">called the Tawny Owl.&nbsp;</span></em></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good evening everyone. You’re all likely to be familiar with pictures of the tawny
      owl,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">because of all the owl species in the UK it’s actually the most
      <span class="explainq1 explain">common</span> one. But the chances are that you’re more likely to have heard one
      than actually seen one, as it’s also strongly nocturnal. This means that it normally ventures out at night.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what kind of habitat does the tawny owl prefer? Well, a survey carried out in
      the nineteen eighties confirmed that this owl is most likely to be found in <span
        class="explainq2 explain">woodland</span>. If you look at a map of tawny owl distribution across Britain, you’ll
      only see gaps in the treeless marshy areas of eastern England, and in some of the more upland parts of north-west
      Scotland. However, you can sometimes find populations of tawny owls in urban areas too, either in parks or in
      large gardens.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tawny owl shows some obvious adaptations to its natural habitat. For example,
      both its wings and its <span class="explainq3 explain">tail</span> are short, which helps it to manoeuvre through
      the trees. Also the bird’s plumage is a mixture of brown and <span class="explainq4 explain">grey</span>, and this
      provides suitable camouflage for when the owl perches up against a tree trunk. Then, there are its large eyes. The
      tawny owl's visual capacities are considerably better than those of <span class="explainq5 explain">humans</span>,
      and although it can’t see in complete darkness, it’s sufficiently well equipped to be able to navigate its way
      around woodland on all but the most overcast nights. Another factor that contributes to the tawny owl's success as
      a hunter, is its excellent <span class="explainq6 explain">memory</span> of the layout of different areas. If you
      combine this ability with the owl’s strongly territorial and sedentary nature - most populations of tawny owl are
      'sit and wait’ predators - you realise that it has a good opportunity to predict where prey might be found.
      Finally, as well as having large eyes, the owl’s sense of <span class="explainq7 explain">hearing</span> is
      excellent, and this helps it to locate potential prey as it sits on its perch.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turning now to the tawny owl’s diet ... Woodland tawny owls feed mainly on
      mammals,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">especially small ones such as wood mice and bank voles. But
      they’ll also take things like frogs, or bats or even fish, if they happen to be available. In urbanised
      landscapes, the owls seem to prey more on <span class="explainq8 explain">birds</span>. So there are some
      differences there.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s just look briefly now at survival rates in the tawny owl. Young tawny owls
      face a difficult time once they leave home, and two out of every three are likely to die within their first <span
        class="explainq9 explain">year</span>. So with such high mortality levels it’s a good job that established
      breeding pairs can produce young over a number of seasons, and maximise their chances of passing their genes on to
      the next generation of owls.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve already mentioned the sedentary nature of the tawny owl. But it’s not just
      adult tawny owls that are sedentary in their habits. Young birds, dispersing away from where they were born,
      rarely move far - the average distance is just four kilometres. There also appears to be some reluctance to cross
      large bodies of <span class="explainq10 explain">water</span> - the owl is absent from many of the islands around
      our shores, with only occasional sightings in Ireland and the Isle of Wight off the south coast of England.</span>
