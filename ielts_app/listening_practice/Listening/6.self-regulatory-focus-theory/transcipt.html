  <p>Today, I want to talk about self-regulatory focus theory and how the actions of leaders can affect the way
    followers approach different situations. Self-regulatory focus theory is a theory developed by Tori Higgins. He says
    that a person’s focus at any given time is to either approach pleasure or avoid pain. These are two basic
    motivations that each and every one of us has, and they cause us to have different kinds of goals. <span
      class="explainq1 explain">Promotion goals in different life situations emphasise achievement.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p>Prevention goals are oriented towards the avoidance of punishment.</p>
  <p>In a specific situation, our thoughts might focus more on promotion goals or more on prevention goals. The theory
    suggests that two factors affect which goals we are focusing on. First, there is a chronic factor. <span
      class="explainq2 explain">This factor is connected to a person's personality</span></p>
  <p>and says that each person has a basic tendency to either focus more on promotion goals or focus more on prevention
    goals as part of his or her personality. <span class="explainq3 explain">Second, there is a situational factor which
      means that the context we are in can make us more likely to focus on one set of goals or the other.&nbsp;</span>
  </p>
  <p>For example, <span class="explainq4 explain">we are more likely to be thinking about pleasure and to have promotion
      goals when we are spending time with a friend.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p>In contrast, if we are working on an important project for our boss, we are more likely to try to avoid making
    mistakes and therefore have more prevention goals in our mind.</p>
  <p>Research has shown that the goals we are focusing on at a given time affect the way we think. For example, <span
      class="explainq5 explain">when focusing on promotion goals, people consider their ideal self. their aspirations
      and gains.</span></p>
  <p>They don't think about what they can lose, so they think in a happier mode. They feel more inspired to change.</p>
  <p>When people are focusing on prevention goals, they think about their “ought" self. What are they supposed to be?
    What are people expecting from them? They consider their obligations to others. As a result, they experience more
    anxiety and try to avoid situations where they could lose.</p>
  <p>Now that I have talked about the two focuses and how they affect people, I want to look at the idea that <span
      class="explainq6 explain">the way leaders behave, or their style of leading, can affect the focus that followers
      adopt in a specific situation.</span></p>
  <p>In talking about leadership, we often mention transformational leaders and transactional leaders. <span
      class="explainq7 explain">Transformational leaders, when interacting with their followers, focus on their
      development.</span></p>
  <p>In their words and actions transformational leaders highlight change. Their speech is passionate and conveys a
    definitive<span class="explainq8 explain"> vision.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p>All of these things can encourage followers to think about what could be. &nbsp;In other words, they inspire a
    promotion focus in their followers.</p>
  <p>In contrast, <span class="explainq9 explain">transactional leaders focus on developing clear structures that tell
      their&nbsp;followers exactly what is expected of them.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p>While they do explain the rewards people will get for following orders, they emphasise more how a follower will be
    punished or that a follower won't get rewarded if his or her behaviour doesn’t change. In short, they emphasise the
    consequences of making a mistake. This emphasis will clearly lead followers to focus on avoiding punishment and
    problems. This is clearly a prevention focus.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, it is important to understand that one focus is not necessarily better than the other one. For a
    designer who works in a field where a lot of <span class="explainq10 explain">innovation</span> is needed,</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">promotion focus is probably better. In
      contrast, a prevention focus which causes people to work more cautiously and produce higher quality work might be
      very appropriate for a job like a surgeon, for example. The main point of the research, though, is that the
      actions of leaders can greatly influence whether people approach a situation with more of a promotion focus or
      more of a prevention focus.</span></p>
