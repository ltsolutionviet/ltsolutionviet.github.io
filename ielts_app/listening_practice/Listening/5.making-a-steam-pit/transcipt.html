    <p>Good morning everyone, and welcome to our outdoor survival programme. As you know,&nbsp;this week you’ll be
        learning some of the basic information and skills you need to look after yourself independently in the outdoors.
        These first two days we’ll be based here in the classroom, and then we’ll be taking a camping trip to put into
        practice some of the things you’ve learned.</p>
    <p>I’m going to start off with the topic of food. And to start with I’ll describe just two methods which we’ll be
        putting into practice at our camp, and which make use of natural resources: the steam pit and the bamboo pot.
        I’ve got two posters here to make things clearer ... And I’ll start with the steam pit here ...</p>
    <p>To make this you’ll need some dry sticks, some grass, some loose earth and some stones. And for this week only,
        some matches!</p>
    <p>The first thing you do is to <strong>dig a shallow pit</strong> in the place you’ve chosen to do your cooking.
        Let’s say about twenty five centimetres deep, and thirty centimetres wide. Your <span
            class="explainq1 explain">sticks</span> have to be a bit wider than the pit, because you have to put a line
        of them along the top from one end of the pit to the other. Before setting light to these you take some large
        <span class="explainq2 explain">stones</span> and arrange them on top. Then you start the fire and wait till the
        wooden platform burns through and the stones fall into the pit. At this point, <strong>brush away</strong> any
        pieces of hot <span class="explainq3 explain">ash</span> from the stones - you can use a handful of grass - and
        then take another stick and push it down into the centre of the pit, between the stones. After that you
        <strong>cover the whole pi</strong>t with a thick layer of <span class="explainq4 explain">grass</span>. And
        then you can <strong>put your food</strong> on it. <strong>wrapped</strong> in more pieces of grass, like
        parcels. Finally, <strong>cover the whole thing</strong> with <span class="explainq5 explain">earth</span>. You
        have to pat it firmly to seal the pit. Then all you have to do is take the stick out and <strong>pour</strong> a
        bit of <span class="explainq6 explain">water</span> into the opening that it leaves. It should take about four
        hours for your food to cook, as it cooks slowly in the steam that’s created inside the pit.</p>
    <p>So ... simple but effective. The other method you’re going to practise this week is the&nbsp;<strong>bamboo
            oven</strong>. Now the steam pit is ideal in certain conditions because the heat is below ground level, for
        example, if there’s a strong wind and you’re afraid a fire might spread. But when it’s safe to have an open fire
        you can use the bamboo oven method. You get a length of bamboo, which as you probably know is hollow, and
        consists of a number of individual sections with a wall in-between. You use a sharp stick to make a hole in each
        of the dividing walls apart from the end one. Then you lean the bamboo over a fire, with the top propped up by a
        forked stick and the bottom sitting on the ground. You pour enough water in the top to fill the bottom section,
        and then <span class="explainq7 explain">light a fire underneath that section to heat the water</span>. Then you
        put your food inside the top section, and the <span class="explainq8 explain">steam coming up the bamboo through
            the holes you made cooks it</span>.</p>
    <p>I’m going to move on now, to food itself, and talk about some of the wild plants you might cook. I’m going to
        begin with <strong>fungi</strong> - that’s mushrooms and <strong>toadstools</strong>. I’m sure you’ll be aware
        that some of these are <strong>edible</strong>, and they’re delicious, but some of them are
        highly&nbsp;<strong>poisonous</strong>. Now whether they’re <strong>poisonous</strong> or not, all fungi that
        you find in the wild should be cooked before eating, because that helps to destroy any compounds in them that
        might be mildly toxic. But be aware that <span class="explainq9 explain">any amount of cooking won’t make
            poisonous varieties any safer to eat</span>. Unless you can definitely identify a <strong>fungus</strong>
        you should never eat it. It’s not worth the risk. And you need to be really sure, because <span
            class="explainq10 explain">some fungi that are poisonous are very similar in appearance to certain edible
            varieties</span>. They can easily be mistaken for each other. So ... having said all that, fungi are
        delicious when they’re freshly picked, and although they are only <strong>moderately</strong> nutritious, they
        do contain minerals which the body needs.</p>
    <p>I’ll move on now to leafy plants, which are generally ...</p>
