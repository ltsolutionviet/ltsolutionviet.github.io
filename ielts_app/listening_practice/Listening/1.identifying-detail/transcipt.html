      It’s a typical house window really. It’s got an outer square frame and
      then there are two rectangular windows inside the frame.
      <span class="explainq1 explain"
        >The window on the left has a handle halfway up in the middle</span
      >
      and the right-hand side has a small window at the top, with a handle.
    </li>

      It’s quite a simple design.
      <span class="explainq2 explain"
        >It looks like one tube but in fact there are two cylindrical
        tubes</span
      >
      - an outer one and an inner one. They’re both decorated with stripes. The
      inner one is longer and thinner than the outer one, so that when you stand
      it on its end, it looks like a telescope.

      I’m going to get some new glasses and I really like these. The frame’s
      made of metal and it’s quite thin. You can see a darker edge at the top of
      the lenses but
      <span class="explainq3 explain"
        >the sides and the bottom have no frame at all</span
      >. They’re good, I think, because I have quite small facial features. Also
      the lenses are oval, which suits the shape of my face.
