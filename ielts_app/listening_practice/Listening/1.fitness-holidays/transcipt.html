          <p>In this session in your training day we’re going to look at some of the more specialised holidays we offer
            at BC Travel. Now, the travel business is very competitive and it’s important to be aware of how the
            market’s changing and developing. In terms of age groups, <span class="explainq1 explain">&nbsp;the over 65s
              are an important market, and one that’s increasing steadily year on year. The f</span>ewest holidays are
            taken by the 31 to 42-year-olds, and that figure shows no sign of rising. The biggest market at present is
            still the youngest group, the 16 to 30s, but this group’s also seen the biggest drop over the last few
            years, <span class="explainq2 explain">&nbsp; whereas there’s a noticeable growth in the number of holidays
              taken by the 55 to 64-year-olds.</span> As far as the 43 to 54-year-olds are concerned, bookings there are
            steady, but I have to say we haven’t seen the increase we expected.</p>
          <p>One trend we’re noticing with nearly all age groups is the growing popularity of holidays in which clients
            do some kind of specialised activity. I’m not talking here about adventure holidays, where clients take part
            in high-risk activities like white water rafting just for the thrill of it. Activity holidays usually
            involve rather less high-risk sports, or things like art and music. they’re not necessarily cheaper than
            ordinary holidays, often the opposite, in fact. But <span class="explainq3 explain">&nbsp; they do often
              take place outside the main tourist centres, which gives an opportunity for clients to find out more about
              the local people and customs, a</span>nd many say this is one of the most positive features of these
            holidays. Of course, they offer the chance to develop a new skill or&nbsp;talent, <span
              class="explainq4 explain">&nbsp; but clients often say that more than this, it’s the chance to create
              lasting relationships with other like-minded people that’s the main draw.</span></p>

          <p>Let me give you some examples of BC Travel activity holidays. Our painting holidays take place in four
            different centres in France and Italy and they’re very popular with clients of all abilities from beginners
            onwards. <span class="explainq5 explain">We've got an excellent team of artists to lead the classes - some
              of them have been with us from the start, and five additional ones will be joining us this year</span> so
            that we can offer a greater number of classes in each centre.</p>
          <p>As far as cooking holidays are concerned. I know a <span class="explainq6 explain">lot of agents offer
              holidays where clients cook redoes related to one particular country. usually the one they’re staving in.
              but we focus on dishes from a great many different ones</span>. Apart from that you’ll find the usual
            emphasis on good quality, organic ingredients - that’s more or less a given nowadays - and there are
            generally some meat-free recipes included.</p>
          <p>Our photography holidays take place in a wide range of countries from Iceland to Vietnam, and clients have
            the opportunity to see some stunning scenery. Groups are small, no more than eight. <span
              class="explainq7 explain">so clients can have one-on-one tuition during the holiday</span>. and excursions
            are arranged with fully-trained guides. At the end of each holiday an exhibition is held of the photographs
            taken so that clients can see one another’s work and receive valuable feedback<br>from the tutor.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;Finally, let me tell you about our .fitness holidays. In Ireland and Italy we run one-week general
            fitness classes for all ages and levels of fitness. Clients start the course with a consultation with a
            trainer, and together they draw up ah individual programme. As well as improving general fitness, <span
              class="explainq8 explain">clients find that they end up losing much of the stress they’ve built up in
              their daily lives.</span></p>
          <p><span class="explainq9 explain">In Greece, we have a two-week holiday for clients who want to do something
              about their weight</span>. This has all the features you’d expect, like a personalised diet programme. but
            one of its most popular features is that the exercise classes are all held on the beach. People say it’s far
            preferable to being in a gym.</p>
          <p>finally, we offer several holidays in Morocco. One very popular one is the mountain biking holiday. Bikes
            are provided and there are different routes according to people’s ability. <span
              class="explainq10 explain">We offer one which is tailored to the needs of families</span>, which is
            particular popular.</p>
          <p>OK, so that’s about all the time I have today, so thank you very much ...</p>
