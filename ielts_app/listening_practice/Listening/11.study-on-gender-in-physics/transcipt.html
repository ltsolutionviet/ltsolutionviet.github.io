    <h2>Study on Gender in Physics</h2>

  </div>
  <p><strong>LISA:</strong></p>
  <p>OK, Greg, so I finally managed to read the article you mentioned - the one about the study on gender in physics.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>GREG:</strong></p>
  <p>About the study of college students done by Akira Miyake and his team? Yeah. I was interested that the researchers
    were actually a mix of psychologists and physicists.&nbsp;That’s an unusual combination.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>LISA:</strong></p>
  <p>Yeah. I got a little confused at first about which students the study was based on.</p>
  <p>They weren’t actually majoring in physics - <span class="explainq1 explain">they were majoring in what’s known as
      the STEM disciplines. That’s science, technology. engineering and ...</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>GREG:</strong></p>
  <p><span class="explainq1 explain">... and math</span>. Yes, but they were all doing physics courses as part of their
    studies</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>LISA:</strong></p>
  <p>That’s correct. So as I understood it, Miyake and co started from the fact that women are underrepresented in
    introductory physics courses at college, and also that on&nbsp;average, the women who do enrol on these courses
    perform more poorly than the&nbsp;men. No one really knows why this is the case.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>GREG:</strong></p>
  <p><span class="explainq2 explain">Yeah. But what the researchers wanted to find out was basically what they could do
      about the relatively low level of the women’s results</span>. But in order to find a solution they&nbsp;needed to
    find out more about the nature of the problem.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>LISA:</strong></p>
  <p>Right - now let’s see if I can remember... it was that in the physics class, the female students thought the male
    students all assumed that women weren’t any good at</p>
  <p>physics ... was that it? And they thought that the men expected them to get poor results in their tests.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>GREG:</strong></p>
  <p>That’s what the women thought, and that made them nervous, so they did get poor results.&nbsp;<span
      class="explainq3 explain">But actually they were wrong ... No one was making any assumptions about the female
      students at all.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>LISA:</strong></p>
  <p>Anyway, what Miyake’s team did was quite simple - getting the students to do some writing before they went into the
    physics class. What did they call it?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>GREG:</strong></p>
  <p>Values-affirmation <span class="explainq4 explain">they had to write an essay focusing on things that were
      significant, to them not particularly to do with the subject they were studying but more general,&nbsp;things like
      music, or people who mattered to them.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>LISA:</strong></p>
  <p>Right. So the idea of doing the writing is that this gets the students thinking in a positive way.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>GREG:</strong></p>
  <p><span class="explainq5 explain">And cutting these thoughts into words can relax them and help them overcome the
      psychological factors that lead to poor performance.</span> Yeah. <span class="explainq6 explain">But what the
      researchers,&nbsp;in the study hadn’t expected was that this one activity raised the women’s physics grades from
      the C to the B range</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>LISA:</strong></p>
  <p>A huge chance. Pity it wasn’t to an A, but still! No, but it does suggest that the women were seriously
    underperforming beforehand, in comparison with the men.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>GREG:</strong></p>
  <p>Yes. Mind you, Miyake’s article left out a lot of details. Like, did the students do the writing just once, or
    several times? <span class="explainq7 explain">And had they been told why they were doing the&nbsp;writing? That
      might have affected the results.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>LISA:</strong></p>
  <p>You mean, if they know the researchers thought it might help them to improve, then they’d just try to fulfil that
    expectation?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>GREG:</strong></p>
  <p>Exactly.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>GREG:</strong></p>
  <p>So anyway, I thought for our project we could do a similar study, but investigate whether it really was the writing
    activity that had that result.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>LISA:</strong></p>
  <p>OK. So we could ask them to do a writing task about something completely different... something more factual? Like
    a general knowledge topic.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>GREG:</strong></p>
  <p>Maybe ... or we could have half the students doing a writing task and half doing something else, like an oral task.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>LISA:</strong></p>
  <p>Or even <span class="explainq8 explain">half do the same writing task as in the original research and half do a
      factual writing task</span>. Then we’d see if it really is the topic that made the difference, or something else.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>GREG:</strong></p>
  <p>That’s it. Good. So at our meeting with the supervisor on Monday we can toll him we’ve decided on our project. We
    should have our aims ready by then. I suppose we&nbsp;need to read the original study — the article’s just a
    summary.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>LISA:</strong></p>
  <p>And there was another article I read, by Smolinsky. It was about her research on how women and men perform in mixed
    teams in class, compared with single-sex teams and on their own.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>GREG:</strong></p>
  <p>Let me guess ... the women were better at teamwork.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>LISA:</strong></p>
  <p>That’s what I expected, but actually <span class="explainq9 explain">the men and the women got the same results,
      whether they were working in teams or on their own</span>, But I guess it's not that relevant to us.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>GREG:</strong></p>
  <p>What worries me anyway is how we’re going to get everything done in the time.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>USA:</strong></p>
  <p>We’ll be OK now we know what we re doing. Though I’m not clear how we assess whether the students in our experiment
    actually make any progress or not...</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>GREG:</strong></p>
  <p>No. We may need some advice on that. The main thing's to make sure we have the right size sample, not too big or
    too small.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>LISA:</strong></p>
  <p>That shouldn’t be difficult. Right, what do we need to do next? We could have a look at the timetable for the
    science classes ... or perhaps <span class="explainq10 explain">we should just make an appointment to see one of the
      science professors. That'd be better.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>GREG:</strong></p>
  <p>Great. And we could even get to observe one of the classes.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>LISA:</strong></p>
  <p>What for?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>GREG:</strong></p>
  <p>Well ... OK maybe let’s just go with your idea. Right, well ...</p>
