          <p>OK, so we’ve been looking at how man-made changes in our environment can affect wildlife. Now I’ll discuss
            a particular example. Let’s take a look at mercury. Mercury’s one of the 120 or so elements that make up all
            matter, and it has the symbol Hg. It’s a shiny, silvery substance. You may have seen it in old-fashioned
            thermometers, but it’s not used much for domestic purposes now because it’s highly toxic.</p>
          <p>But the problem is that the amount of mercury in the environment's increasing. The main &nbsp;reason for
            this is the power plants used to produce electricity. The main source of energy that most of them use is
            still coal, and when it’s burned it releases mercury into the atmosphere. Some of this gets deposited into
            lakes and rivers, and if it’s ingested by a fish it’s not excreted, it stays in the fish’s body and it
            enters the food chain. So it’s been known for some time that birds which eat fish may be affected, but <span
              class="explainq1 explain">what wasn’t known until quite recently is that those that eat insects can also
              be affected</span>.</p>
          <p>So a woman called Claire Varian-Ramos is doing some research on how this is affecting birds.</p>
          <p>And rather than looking at how many birds are actually killed by mercury poisoning, she’s looking for more
            subtle sub-effects. And <span class="explainq2 explain">these may be to do with the behaviour of the birds,
              or with the effect of mercury on the way their brain works, so whether it leads to problems with memory,
              for example</span>. And she’s particularly focusing on the effects of mercury on bird song. <span
              class="explainq3 explain">Now. the process of song learning happens at a particular stage in the birds’
              development, and what you may not know is that a young bird seems to acquire this skill by listening to
              the songs produced by its father</span>, rather than by any other bird.</p>
          <p>And Varian-Ramos has already found in her research that<span class="explainq4 explain"> if young male birds
              are exposed to mercury. if they eat food contaminated with mercury. then the songs they produce aren’t as
              complex as those produced by other birds</span>. So quite low-level exposure to mercury is likely to have
            an impact on male birds in a natural situation, because it can mean that they’re less attractive to female
            birds, and so <span class="explainq5 explain">it can affect their chances of reproduction</span>.</p>
          <p>Now the way she’s carrying out this research is worth thinking about. She’s using a mixture of studies
            using birds kept in laboratories, and studies carried out outdoors in the wild. <span
              class="explainq6 explain">The lab-based studies have the advantage that you don’t get all the variables
              you would in a natural setting. so the experimenter has a much higher level of control</span>, and that
            means they can be more confident about their results in some ways. And of course they don’t have to worry
            about going out and finding the birds in order to observe them.</p>

          <p>So what are the implications here for humans? Well,<span class="explainq7 explain"> because many birds are
              migratory, they may be transporting mercury far from contaminated sites. For example, it’s been found that
              ducks who’d been feeding at a contaminated site were later shot by hunters over a thousand kilometres
              away, and presumably eaten</span>. But these birds likely had mercury levels high enough to warrant
            concern for human consumption.</p>
          <p>In addition, going back to song learning by birds, we saw that this may be affected by&nbsp;mercury
            contamination. Well, <span class="explainq8 explain">we also know that in humans, mercury causes
              developmental delays in the acquisition of language</span>, and in fact this process is very similar in
            the brain regions it involves and even the genes that are involved. But mercury contamination has other
            important implications for humans as well. <span class="explainq9 explain">It’s now known that an unborn
              child can be affected if the food eaten by its mother contains high levels of mercury</span>, and these
            effects can be quite substantial.</p>
          <p>In the end, it comes down to whether more value is placed on human economic wellbeing&nbsp;or environmental
            wellbeing. <span class="explainq10 explain">It’s true there are new regulations for mercury emissions from
              power plants, but these will need billions of dollars to implement, and increase costs for
              everyone</span>. Some argue that’s too much to pay to protect wildlife. But as we’ve seen, the issues go
            beyond that, and I think it’s an issue we need to consider very carefully.</p>
