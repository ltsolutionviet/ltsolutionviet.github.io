          <p>In public discussion of business, we take certain values for granted. Today I’m going to talk about four of
            them: collaboration, hard work, creativity and &nbsp;excellence. Most people would say they’re all ‘good
            things’. I’m going to suggest that’s an over-simple view.</p>
          <p>The trouble with these values is that they’re theoretical concepts, removed from the reality of day-to-day
            business. <span class="explainq1 explain">Pursue values by all means, but be prepared for what may happen as
              a result. they can actually cause damage, which is not at all the intention</span>.</p>
          <p>Business leaders generally try to do the right thing. But <span class="explainq2 explain">all too often the
              right thing backfires, if those leaders adopt values without understanding and managing the side effects
              that arise</span>. The values can easily get in the way of what’s actually intended.</p>
          <p>OK. So the first value I’m going to discuss is collaboration. Er, let me give you an example. <span
              class="explainq3 explain">On a management training course I once attended, we were put into groups and had
              to construct a bridge across a stream</span>, using building blocks that we were given. The rule was that
            everyone in the team had to move at least one building block during the construction. This was intended to
            encourage teamwork.</p>

          <p>But it was really a job best done by one person. <span class="explainq4 explain">The other teams tried to
              collaborate on building the structure, and descended into confusion</span>, with everyone getting in each
            other’s&nbsp;way. Our team leader solved the challenge brilliantly. She simply asked everyone in the team to
            move a piece a few centimetres, to comply with the rule, and then let the person in the team with an
            aptitude for puzzles like this build it alone. We finished before any other team. My point is that the task
            wasn’t really suited to teamworking, so why make it one?</p>
          <p>Teamwork can also lead to inconsistency - a common cause of poor sales. <span class="explainq5 explain">In
              the case of a smartphone that a certain company launched, one director wanted to target the business
              market, and another demanded it was aimed at consumers. The company wanted both directors to be involved,
              so gave the product a consumer-friendly name, but marketed it to companies. The result was that it met the
              needs of neither group. It would have been better to let one director or the other have his way,&nbsp;not
              both.</span></p>
          <p>Now industriousness, or hard work. It’s easy to mock people who say they work hard: after all, a hamster
            running around in a wheel is working hard - and getting nowhere. Of course <span
              class="explainq6 explain">hard work is valuable, but only when properly targeted. Otherwise it wastes the
              resources that companies value most - time and energy. And that’s bad for the organisation</span>.</p>
          <p>There’s a management model that groups people according to four criteria: clever, hard-working. stupid and
            lazy. <span class="explainq7 explain">Here ‘lazy’ means having a rational determination not to carry out
              unnecessary tasks</span>, it doesn’t mean trying to avoid work altogether. Most people display two of
            these characteristics, and the most valuable people are those who are both clever and lazy: they possess
            intellectual clarity, and they don’t rush into making decisions. They come up with solutions to save the
            time and energy spent by the stupid and hard-working group. Instead of throwing more man-hours at a problem,
            the clever and lazy group looks for a more effective solution.</p>
          <p>Next we come to creativity. This often works well - creating an attention-grabbing TV commercial, for
            example, might lead to increased sales. But it isn’t always a good thing.</p>
          <p>Some advertising campaigns are remembered for their creativity, without having any effect on sales. <span
              class="explainq8 explain">This happened a few years ago with the launch of a chocolate bar: subsequent
              research showed that plenty of consumers remembered the adverts, but had no idea what was being
              advertised</span>. The trouble is that the creator derives pleasure from coming up with the idea, and
            wrongly assumes the audience for the campaign will share that feeling.</p>
          <p>A company that brings out thousands of new products may seem more creative than a company that only has a
            few, but it may be too creative, and make smaller profits. <span class="explainq9 explain">Creativity needs
              to be targeted to solve a problem that the company has identified</span>. Just coming up with more and
            more novel products isn’t necessarily a good thing.</p>
          <p>And finally, excellence, We all know companies that claim they ‘strive for excellence’, but it takes a long
            time to achieve excellence. In business, being first with a product is more profitable than having the best
            product. A major study of company performance compared pioneers - that is, companies bringing out the first
            version of a particular product - with followers, the companies that copied and improved on that product.
            <span class="explainq10 explain">The study found that the pioneers commanded an average market share of 29
              percent, while the followers achieved less than half that, only 13 percent</span> - even though their
            product might have been better.</p>
          <p>Insisting on excellence in everything we do is time-consuming, wastes energy and leads to losing out on
            opportunities. Sometimes, second-rate work is more worthwhile than excellence. ‘Make sure it’s excellent’
            sounds like a good approach to business, but the ‘just-get-started’ approach is likely to be more
            successful.</p>
