    <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will hear a historian giving a presentation about techniques to identify
                the origin of hand­</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">written books from the middle
                ages.&nbsp;</span></em></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historian: &nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">My presentation
            today is on how the science of genetics is being used to shed light on the&nbsp;</span><span
            style="font-weight: 400;">origin of manuscripts - anything written by hand - produced in the medieval period
            ... that is ... the period between the fifth and fifteenth centuries AD.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As many of you know, thousands of medieval handwritten books still exist today.
            Some of them have a clear provenance, that is, we know exactly where and when they were written, but the
            origin of many manuscripts has been a complete mystery, that is, until two thousand and nine when
            geneticists started using DNA testing to shed light on their origins.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But before looking at the new research, I need to explain something about the way
            the manuscripts were produced - particularly what they were written on. Virtually all were written on
            treated animal skins and there were essentially two types. The first was parchment, which is made of sheep
            skin. It has the quality of being very white but also being <span class="explainq1 explain">thin</span>. It
            has a naturally greasy surface which meant it was hard to erase writing from it. This made it much sought
            after for <span class="explainq2 explain">court documents</span> in medieval times.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second type is vellum, which is calf skin. This was most often used for any
            very ‘high- status’ documents because it provided the best writing surface so scribes could achieve
            lettering of <span class="explainq3 explain">high quality</span>.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, once the animal hides had been chosen, they had to be prepared. Where the
            right materials were on hand, the skins were put into large barrels or vats of lime, where they were
            agitated or stirred frequently. But if lime wasn’t available, then the hides were <span
                class="explainq4 explain">buried</span>. Both these techniques were designed to cause the hair to slough
            off, and the skins to become gelatinous and therefore more flexible.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next stage was to put the hides on stretcher frames and pull them very tight.
            While on the frame they were scraped with a moon-shaped knife in order to create a uniform <span
                class="explainq5 explain">thickness</span>. For parchment, that was the end of the process, but for
            vellum there was an additional stage where it was <span class="explainq6 explain">bleached</span>, in order
            to achieve the desired colour.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historian: &nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what does all this
            preparation mean for the quest to identify the origins of ‘mystery’&nbsp;</span><span
            style="font-weight: 400;">manuscripts? Well, until recently the only way historians and other academics were
            able to guess at origins was either through the analysis of the handwriting style, or from the <span
                class="explainq7 explain">dialect</span> in which the piece was written. But these techniques have
            proven unreliable, for a number of reasons.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was thus decided to try to look at the problem from a different angle ... to
            start from what is known, that is, the small number of manuscripts whose origins we do already know. Because
            these parchments and vellum are both made from animal hides, it was possible to subject them to DNA testing
            and to identify the genetic markers for the date and location of production. From this was created what is
            known as a ‘<span class="explainq8 explain">baseline</span>’. The next stage was to test the mystery
            manuscripts, finding their DNA characteristics and then making comparisons between the known and the mystery
            scripts. Genetic similarities and differences enabled the&nbsp;</span><span
            style="font-weight: 400;">scientists to gain more information about the origins of the many manuscripts we
            had known virtually nothing about up to that point.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you might ask - what are the potential uses of this new information? Well,
            obviously, it can shed light on the origin of individual books and manuscripts. But that’s not all. It can
            also shed light on the <span class="explainq9 explain">evolution</span> of the whole of the manuscripts
            production industry in medieval times. And because that was such a thriving business, involving very
            large-scale movements right across the globe, the new data, in turn, help historians establish which <span
                class="explainq10 explain">trade routes</span> were in operation during the whole millennium.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now if anyone has any questions ...</span></p>
