  <p>Erm ... hello Professor, I’m John Wishart. I'm working on my entry for the Global Design Competition. My tutor said
    you might be able to help me with it.</p>
  <p>Ah, yes, I got a copy of your drawings. Come in and tell me about it. What sort of competition is it?</p>
  <p>Well, it’s an international design competition and <span class="explainq1 explain">we have to come up with a new
      design for a typical domestic kitchen appliance.</span> Q21</p>
  <p>I see, and are there any special conditions? Does it have to save energy for example?</p>
  <p>Actually that was the focus in last year’s competition. This year’s different. We have to adopt an innovative
    approach to existing technology, using it in a way that hasn’t been thought of before.</p>
  <p>I see, that sounds tricky. And what kitchen appliance have you chosen? Well, I decided to choose the dishwasher.
  </p>
  <p>Interesting, what made you choose that?</p>
  <p>Well, they’re an everyday kitchen appliance in most Australian houses but they’re all pretty boring and almost
    identical to each other. <span class="explainq2 explain">I think some people will be prepared to pav a little extra
      for something that looks different.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p>That’s a nice idea. I see you’ve called your design 'the Rockpool’; why is that?</p>
  <p>Basically because it looks like the rock pools you find on a beach. The top is made of glass so that you can look
    down into it.</p>
  <p>And there’s a stone at the bottom. Is that just for decoration?</p>
  <p>Actually it does have a function. <span class="explainq3 explain">Instead of pushing a button, you turn the
      stone.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p>So it’s really just a novel way of starting the dishwasher.</p>
  <p>That's right.</p>
  <p>It’s a really nice design, but what makes it innovative?</p>
  <p>Well, I decided to make a dishwasher that uses carbon dioxide.</p>
  <p>In place of water and detergent? How will you manage that?</p>
  <p>The idea is to pressurise the carbon dioxide so that it becomes a liquid.</p>
  <p>The fluid is then released into the dishwasher where it cleans the dishes all by itself.</p>
  <p>Sounds like a brilliant idea! Your system will totally do away with the need for strong detergents. So what happens
    once the dishes are clean?</p>
  <p>Well, to allow them to dry, the liquid carbon dioxide and the waste materials all go to an area called the holding
    chamber. <span class="explainq4 explain">That's where the liquid is depressurised and so it reverts to a gas.</span>
    Then the oil and grease are separated out and sent to the waste system.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It sounds like you’ve thought it all out very thoroughly. So, what happens to the carbon dioxide once the process
    is complete? Not wasted I hope.</p>
  <p>Actually, that’s where the real savings are made. <span class="explainq5 explain">The carbon dioxide is sent back
      to the cylinder and can be used again and again.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p>What a terrific idea. Do you think it will ever be built?</p>
  <p>Probably not, but that’s OK.</p>
  <p>Well, I'm sure a lot of positive things will come out of your design.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Now, you seem to have thought about everything so what exactly did you need me to help you with?</p>
  <p>Well, my design has made it to the final stage of the competition and, <span class="explainq6 explain">in a few
      months’ time, I have to give a presentation, and that's the part I was hoping you could help me with.&nbsp;</span>
  </p>
  <p>Right, well that should be easy enough. What have you managed to do so far?</p>
  <p>Well, I’ve got detailed drawings to show how it will work and I’ve also written a 500-word paper on it.</p>
  <p>I see. Well, <span class="explainq7 explain">if you want to stand a good chance of winning vou really need a model
      of the machine.</span></p>
  <p>Yes, I thought I might but I’m having a few problems.</p>
  <p>What is the main.difficulty so far? Let me guess - is it the materials?</p>
  <p><span class="explainq8 explain">Yes. I want it to look professional but everything that’s top quality is also very
      expensive.</span></p>
  <p>Look, projects like this are very important to us. They really help lift our profile. <span
      class="explainq9 explain">So why don’t you talk to the university about a grant?</span> I can help you fill out
    the application forms if you like.</p>
  <p>That would be great.</p>
  <p>You’d better show me this paper you’ve written as well. <span class="explainq10 explain">For a global competition
      such as this vou need to make sure the technical details you’ve given are accurate and thorough.</span></p>
  <p>That would be a great help.</p>
  <p>Is there anything else I can do?</p>
  <p>Well, I’m really...</p>
