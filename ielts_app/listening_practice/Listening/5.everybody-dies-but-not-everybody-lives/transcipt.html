  <p>It is not death most people are afraid of, it is getting to the end of life, only to realize that you never truly
    lived.<br>There was a study done, a hospital study on 100 elderly people facing death close to their last breath.
    They were asked to reflect about their life’s biggest regret. Nearly all of them said they <span
      class="explainq1 explain">regretted not the things they did but the things they didn’t do</span>. The risks they
    never took, the dreams they didn’t pursue.</p>
  <p>People don’t choose dreams, dreams choose them. Do you have the courage to grab the dream that picked you? That
    befit you and grips you? Or will you let it get away and slip through?</p>
  <p>Many passengers think planes are dangerous to fly in. But actually,<span class="explainq2 explain"> it is a lot
      more dangerous for a plane to stay on the ground</span>. Because on the ground, the plane starts to rust,
    malfunction and wear, much faster than it ever would if it was in the air.<br>Because planes were built to live in
    the skies. And every person was built to live out the dream they have inside. So it is perhaps the saddest loss to
    live a life on the ground without ever taking off.</p>
  <p>Most of us are afraid of the thief, they comes in the night to steal all of our things. But there is a thief in
    your mind who is after your dreams. His name is <span class="explainq3 explain">doubt</span>. If you see him call
    the cops and keep him away from the kids because he is wanted for murder, he has killed more dreams than failure
    ever did. He wears many disguises and like a virus will leave you blinded, divided and turn you into a "kinda".</p>
  <p>"Kinda" is lethal. You know what "kinda" is? There is a lot of "kinda" people. You "kinda" want a career change,
    you "kinda" want to get straight A’s, you "kinda" want to get in shape. If you "kinda" want something, then you will
    "kinda" get the results you want.</p>
  <p>What is your dream? What ignites that spark? You can’t "kinda" want that, you got to want it with every part of
    your whole heart. Will you struggle? Yeah! Yeah, you will struggle, no way around it. You will fall many times, but
    who’s counting? Just remember, there’s no such thing as a smooth mountain.</p>
  <p>If you want to make it to the top then there are sharp ridges that have to be stepped over. There will be times you
    get stressed and things you get depressed over. Struggle and criticisms are prerequisites for <span
      class="explainq4 explain">greatness</span>. That is the law of this universe and no one escapes it. Because pain
    is life but you can choose what type? Either the pain on the road to success or the pain of being haunted with
    regret.</p>
  <p>You want my advice? Don’t think twice. We have been given a gift that we call <span
      class="explainq5 explain">life</span>. So don’t blow it. You’re not defined by your past instead you were born
    anew in each moment. So own it now.</p>
  <p>Sometimes you’ve got to leap and grow your wings on the way down. You better get the shot off before the clock runs
    out because there is ain’t no over time in life, no do over.</p>
  <p>So what invention that you have buried in your mind? What idea? What cure? What skill did you have inside to bring
    out to this universe? Uni- meaning one, -verse meaning song. You have a part to play in this song. So grab that
    microphone and be brave. Sing your heart out on life’s stage. You cannot go back and make a brand new beginning.</p>
