          <p>Welcome to this podcast about the Sheepmarket, which is one of the oldest parts of the city. As its name
            suggests, there was originally a market here where farmers brought their sheep, but now it’s been
            redeveloped into a buzzing, vibrant area of the city, which is also home to one of the city’s
            fastest-growing communities. The nearby university has always meant the area’s popular with students, who
            come in to enjoy the lively nightlife. but <span class="explainq1 explain">now graduates embarking on
              careers in the worlds of fashion and design are buying up the new apartments recently built here to
              replace the small houses where the market workers used to live</span>.</p>
          <p><span class="explainq2 explain">The narrow old side streets are great places for finding original pictures,
              jewellery and ceramics</span> which won’t break the bank, as well as local produce like fruit and
            vegetables. There’s also lots of pavement cafes where you can have a coffee and watch tourists from
            all&nbsp;over the world go by. The oldest buildings in the area are on the main streets, including the
            city’s first department store, built in the 1880s, which is still open today.</p>

          <p>The Sheepmarket is a centre for fashion, and there’s a policy of encouraging new young designers. The Young
            Fashion competition is open to local young people who are passionate about fashion. T<span
              class="explainq3 explain">his year they’ve been asked to design an outfit based on ideas from the music
              and technology that’s part of their everyday life</span>, using both natural and man-made fibres. The
            garments will be judged by a panel of experts and fashion designers, and the winning entries will be
            modelled at a special gala evening.</p>
          <p>Parking at the Sheepmarket is easy. There are plenty of pay and display car parking spaces on the roadsides
            which are fine if you just want to stay for an hour or two, but if you want to spend the day there it’s
            better to park in one of the four underground car parks. It’s not expensive and <span
              class="explainq4 explain">if you can present a receipt from one of the local stores, you’ll not be charged
              at all</span>. After six pm many of the car parks have a fiat rate which varies but it is usually very
            reasonable.</p>
          <p>The Sheepmarket is one of the main centres for art and history in the whole of the country.</p>
          <p>If you look at our map, you’ll see some of the main attractions there. Most visitors start
            from&nbsp;Crawley Road, at the bottom of the map. <span class="explainq5 explain">The Reynolds House is one
              of the oldest houses in the city, and is open to the public. It’s on the north side of Crawley Road, next
              to the footpath that leads to the public gardens.</span></p>
          <p>The area’s particularly interested for its unusual sculptures. <span class="explainq6 explain">'The Thumb’
              is just what its name suggests. but it’s about 10 metres high. You’ll see iron Hill Road, across the road
              from the Bank.</span></p>
          <p><span class="explainq7 explain">The Museum’s got a particularly fine collection of New Zealand landscapes.
              It’s on the east side of the Sheepmarket. on City Road. It’s on the other side of the road from the public
              gardens. immediately facing the junction with Hill Road.</span></p>
          <p><span class="explainq8 explain">The Contemporary Art Gallery is on a little road that leads off Station
              Square. not far from the public gardens. The road ends at the gallery - it doesn’t go anywhere
              else</span>. That’s open every day except Mondays.</p>
          <p><span class="explainq9 explain">The Warner Gallery specialises in 19th-century art. It’s on City Road, near
              the junction with&nbsp;Crawley Road, on the same side of the road as the public gardens</span>. It’s open
            on weekdays from 9 to 5, and entry is free.</p>
          <p><span class="explainq10 explain">Finally, if you’re interested in purchasing high quality artwork, the
              place to ao is Nucleus. You need to ao from Crawley Road up through Station Square and east along Hill
              Road until you get to a small winding road turning off. Go up there and it’s on your right - if you get to
              city Road you’ve gone too far.</span></p>
