    <h2> The issue of waste</h2>

  </div>
  <p><span class="font5">Lecturer: Good afternoon, everybody. Today I'll be talking about the issue of waste, which has
      become an immense problem in&nbsp;today's society. We face huge challenges in terms of reducing its&nbsp;creation
      in the first place and then in dealing with it when it has&nbsp;been created. Now, the model of nature would be
      our ideal - a&nbsp;completely cyclical system in which no excess waste is generated&nbsp;that can't be processed
      by itself. However, we humans have&nbsp;proved, despite our apparent intelligence and ingenuity,
      quite&nbsp;incapable of achieving this. Where did it all go wrong? We have&nbsp;evidence that in ancient <span
        style="color: #0000ff;">Greece</span> and <span style="color: #0000ff;">Rome</span> governments
      operated&nbsp;municipal waste collection, and a huge Stone Age <span
        style="background-color: #ffff00;">mound</span> <span
        style="background-color: #00ffff;">was&nbsp;identified</span> some years ago in </span><span
      class="font5 explainq1 explain" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;">Norway</span><span
      class="font5"> as <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">waste disposal</span>, so we can&nbsp;see that people
      have been </span><span class="font5" style="font-style: italic;">generating waste for a very long
      time&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">indeed. However, during the Dark Ages, sophisticated municipal&nbsp;waste
    </span><span class="font5" style="font-style: italic;">processing disappeared.</span><span class="font5"> The
    </span><span class="font5" style="font-style: italic;">medieval answer to</span><span class="font5"> waste
      was&nbsp;to throw it out of the window.&nbsp;<span class="font5">But this waste, apart from broken&nbsp;<span
          style="color: #0000ff;">pottery</span> and a few <span style="color: #0000ff;">metal objects</span>, was <span
          style="background-color: #00ff00;">largely </span></span><span class="font5 explainq2 explain"
        style="color: #0000ff;">organic</span><span class="font5">.</span></span></p>

    </ul>
  </div>
  <p><span class="font5">&nbsp;This meant,&nbsp;of course, that it was quickly absorbed into the environment by&nbsp;the
      <span style="color: #ff0000;">natural processes of decay</span>. However, many concerned<span
        style="color: #ff0000;"> people,&nbsp;such as doctors, claimed</span> that this created <span
        style="color: #ff0000;">health</span> problems,&nbsp;although it wasn't until <strong>science</strong> <span
        style="background-color: #ffcc00;">produced</span> convincing evidence of&nbsp;the connection between <span
        style="background-color: #00ff00;"><strong>rubbish</strong> </span>and </span><span
      class="font5 explainq3 explain" style="text-decoration: underline;">disease</span><span class="font5"> that
      governments&nbsp;began to see the importance of dealing with the problem&nbsp;effectively.</span></p>
  <div style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid black; background-color: #dddddd;"><span class="font5"><span
        class="font5"><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">'<span
          style="background-color: #ffcc00;">Link</span>' in the question is expressed as '<span
          style="background-color: #ffcc00;">produced&nbsp;convincing evidence of the connection between'</span> in
        the&nbsp;'&nbsp;tapescript, and '<strong>waste</strong>' in the question is '<span
          style="background-color: #00ff00;"><strong>rubbish</strong></span>' in the tapescript. '<span
          style="color: #ff0000;">Health</span>' is not the correct answer, as this refers to part of the tapescript
        where 'people, such as doctors, claimed' something in relation to the 'natural processes of
        decay’.</span></span></div>
  <p><span class="font5"> Unfortunately, their response has remained slower&nbsp;than the generation of waste. It is
      very hard to deal with waste&nbsp;that won't melt into the environment, as so many of our <em><span
          style="color: #ff0000;">modern&nbsp;consumer goods</span></em> won't, and that's why the invention of
    </span><span class="font5 explainq4 explain" style="text-decoration: underline;">plastic</span><span
      class="font5"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> has&nbsp;caused the worst headache for the environment</span> - it's
      more than&nbsp;nature can deal with.</span></p>
  <div style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid black; background-color: #dddddd;"><strong>Note:</strong> Plastic, we are
    told, '<strong>has caused the worst headache</strong>' - '<strong>is the biggest problem</strong>'. '<em><span
        style="color: #ff0000;">Modern consumer goods</span></em>' is not the answer: firstly, they are not a single
    invention; secondly, you cannot write this answer in <strong>‘no more than one word</strong>', as the rubric
    requires.</div>
  <p><span class="font5">In order to address the root of the problem of waste, we need to think about what has made the
      quantity of waste accelerate in&nbsp;growth. I'd identify three main reasons. <em>As many countries
        became&nbsp;<span style="color: #ff0000;">industrialised</span>, we saw the&nbsp;<span
          style="color: #ff0000;">advent</span>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<span style="color: #0000ff;"><span
            class="explainq5 explain">mass manufacturing</span>.</span>&nbsp;This has been enormously&nbsp;<span
          style="color: #ff0000;">damaging</span>&nbsp;as it&nbsp;has greatly increased the&nbsp;<span
          style="color: #ff0000;">amount of things</span>&nbsp;on the planet's&nbsp;surface which don't go away by
        themselves.</em></span></p>
  <div style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid black; background-color: #dddddd;">
    <p><span class="font5">Why are these answers not correct?</span></p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="font5"><span class="font5">industrialised --&gt; '</span></span><span
          style="color: #ff0000;">Industrialised</span>' is an <strong>adjective</strong>, not a <strong>noun</strong>.
        A 'factor' needs to be a noun, or a noun with an adjective.</li>
      <li><span class="font5">the advent of manufacturing --&gt;&nbsp;'<em><span style="color: #ff0000;">The advent of
              manufacturing</span></em>' is wrong for two reasons. Firstly, it consists of four words, and the question
          allows a maximum of two. Secondly, the problem of waste is specifically related to mass manufacturing, not
          just manufacturing</span></li>
      <li><span class="font5"><span class="font5">damaging --&gt;&nbsp;</span></span>'<span
          style="color: #ff0000;">Damaging</span>' is an <strong>adjective</strong>, not a <strong>noun</strong>. It
        does not make sense, as '<strong>damaging</strong>' cannot lead to an increase in waste.</li>
      <li><span class="font5"><span class="font5">amount of things --&gt;&nbsp;</span></span><span
          style="color: #ff0000;">'Amount of things</span>' is wrong for two reasons. Firstly, it consists of three
        words, and the question allows a maximum of two. Secondly, it has been taken from the tapescript without its
        context, so it doesn't really make sense. In the tapescript, the ‘amount of things' is carefully defined as 'on
        the planet's surface that don't go away by themselves'.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p><span class="font5">Closely related to this is </span><span class="font5 explainq6 explain"
      style="text-decoration: underline;">packaging</span><span class="font5"> - necessary for<em><span
          style="color: #ff0000;">&nbsp;transporting things</span></em> around the world, but then extremely
      difficult&nbsp;to get rid of properly. </span></p>
  <div style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid black; background-color: #dddddd;"><strong>Note:</strong> '<span
      style="color: #ff0000;">Transporting things</span>' is not the correct answer. Transporting goods is one of the
    reasons why <strong>packaging</strong> is used, but it is the packaging itself which forms waste.</div>
  <p><span class="font5">And a third aspect to the problem has been&nbsp;</span><span class="font5 explainq7 explain"
      style="text-decoration: underline;">disposable goods</span><span class="font5">. We have become accustomed to so
      many&nbsp;things being to use and then discard that we find it hard to&nbsp;imagine life without them. And yet we
      spare little thought for&nbsp;where they go when we do discard them.</span></p>
  <div style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid black; background-color: #dddddd;"><strong>Note:</strong> Both words are
    necessary: '<strong>goods</strong>' alone would not describe the reason for the increase in waste, which is that
    more goods are now designed to be thrown away after use.</div>
  <p><span class="font5">Right now, let's move on from where all this waste comes from to what is done with it all now
      it's here. Different countries deal with&nbsp;waste differently. Of course, each country also changes what
      it&nbsp;does, so the figures for waste treatment I've got here are likely to&nbsp;change in the future. Let's look
      at Municipal Solid Waste, or MSW.&nbsp;MSW is important to consider because it's effectively a&nbsp;measurement of
      consumerism - how much waste people produce&nbsp;that goes beyond the absolute basic requirements in life to
      eat&nbsp;and drink. </span></p>
  <p><span class="font5"><em>One of the main ways of dealing with&nbsp;MSW&nbsp;is <span
          style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>incineration</strong> </span>-burning it. This is adopted variously around the
        world. The&nbsp;<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>UK</strong>&nbsp;</span>burns relatively little waste, as
        does the&nbsp;<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>US</strong></span>, while&nbsp;<span
          style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Denmark</strong>&nbsp;</span>burns about half of all waste, and&nbsp;<span
          class="explainq8 explain"><strong>Japan</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #0000ff;">uses this method
          for as&nbsp;much as three quarters</span>.</em></span></p>
  <div style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid black; background-color: #dddddd;"><span
      class="font5"><em><strong>Notes:</strong> You hear four countries, the&nbsp;<strong>UK</strong>,
        the&nbsp;<strong>US</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Denmark</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Japan</strong>, mentioned very
        closely together. The possible answers,&nbsp;<strong>A, C, E</strong>&nbsp;and<strong>&nbsp;F</strong>, are all
        heard, and you must be able to distinguish&nbsp;<strong>C</strong>&nbsp;as&nbsp;the only correct
        one.</em></span></div>
  <p><span class="font5">&nbsp;These are broad brush&nbsp;strokes, of course, because an important issue is how
      efficient and&nbsp;clean the burning process is. Another major form of waste&nbsp;treatment is using </span><span
      class="font5" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;">landfill</span><span class="font5"> sites -
      basically, burying the waste in&nbsp;the earth. Currently, this method is the </span><span class="font5"
      style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;">dominant process
        used</span> in&nbsp;the <span class="explainq9 explain">UK</span> at over 80%.</span><span class="font5"> and is
      also heavily used in <span style="color: #ff0000;">Germany</span> and in&nbsp;the <span
        style="color: #ff0000;">US</span>, while densely populated and mountainous countries such&nbsp;as <span
        style="color: #ff0000;">Switzerland</span> and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Japan</span> dispose of relatively
      little this way.</span></p>
  <div style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid black; background-color: #dddddd;"><strong>Note</strong>: Five possible
    answers are mentioned. E is the correct answer, because it <span style="color: #0000ff;">'is the dominant process
      used in the UK</span>'. In the other countries, it is used to varying degrees - from 'heavily' in Germany to
    'relatively' in Switzerland and Japan - but not as 'the highest proportion', as the question asks.</div>
  <p><span class="font5"> A&nbsp;third - and much better way of dealing with waste is to </span><span class="font5"
      style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;">recycle</span><span class="font5"> it,&nbsp;turning it back
      into more things we need. It must be said that&nbsp;much depends here on whether further waste is generated by
      the&nbsp;recycling processes themselves. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">UK</span> and <span
        style="color: #ff0000;">Japan</span> have rather&nbsp;poor records in recycling, while </span><span
      class="font5" style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="explainq10 explain">Switzerland</span> <span
        style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;">tops the table in this&nbsp;respect</span>,</span><span
      class="font5"> and reasonably impressive levels are achieved by&nbsp;<span style="color: #ff0000;">Denmark</span>
      and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Germany</span>. I really hope that if we all gathered here&nbsp;again ten years
      from now, these figures would be much higher.&nbsp;Time - and a lot of effort - will tell.</span>&nbsp;</p>
  <div style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid black; background-color: #dddddd;"><strong>Note:</strong> Five possible
    answers are mentioned. Denmark and Germany are 'reasonably impressive', the UK and Japan 'rather poor'. None of
    these uses 'the highest proportion', as the question asks, but Switzerland<span style="color: #0000ff;"> 'tops the
      table in this respect</span>'.</div>
