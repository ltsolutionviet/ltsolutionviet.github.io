  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>You will hear the Education Officer in a museum giving a talk to school
        students who are about to start a one-week work placement in the museum.</em>&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good morning and welcome. We’re really pleased that you’re going to be joining us
      next week for your work placement. Now, each of you will already have met the member of museum staff assigned to
      supervise you. In this short talk today I’ll be giving you more general information which will be relevant to all
      six of you. Your normal working day is nine to five p.m. but on Monday, because it’s your first day, we’d like you
      to arrive at <span class="explainq1 explain">quarter to nine</span>. Please note, though, that you’ll finish at
      the usual time.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of you have been asking what you should wear for work. Well, you may have
      noticed that we’re not exactly a formal institution so you’d really be out of place if you wear smart attire like
      a suit. If you go out on a trip with us, then we’d like you to wear a museum cap ... it has our logo on and we
      feel it helps people recognise you. But, on a day-to-day basis in the museum itself we say put on your own<span
        class="explainq2 explain"> casual clothing</span> because you’ll be doing lots of dusty, messy work!</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, we don’t have an enormous number of rules but work placement is an excellent
      preparation for the real world of work and we expect you to be very punctual and reliable. If you’re not well or
      there’s been a hold-up then what we ask you to do is ring the <span class="explainq3 explain">museum
        receptionist</span> ... he will be in the museum well ahead of opening time and he’ll inform your own personal
      supervisor in the museum. If you’re away for more than one day, we’ll inform your school tutor . they’ll obviously
      need to make a note of your absence and follow up if necessary.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But most of all we hope you really enjoy yourselves during the placement. Students
      say they have a lot of fun, whether it’s working with kids in our art workshops held every Monday or, <span
        class="explainq4 explain">the most popular, when they go out on our out-reach work to residential homes</span>,
      recording elderly people’s memories of school days for our oral history project.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we hope you feel excited by the prospect of starting next week and well
      prepared. Your personal supervisor will be there to help you with our health and safety requirements when you
      start next week and your supervisors will also brief you about the background to the museum, summarising all the
      huge amount of information on our website. In the next couple of days it might be worthwhile if you get hold of
      evaluations and other <span class="explainq5 explain">notes made by students who’ve worked with us before</span>
      you can get a lot of pointers from them.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now before I finish today, I wanted to help you find your way around the museum.
      When you start next Monday, the first thing you’ll need to do is <span class="explainq6 explain">sign in.
      </span></span>Come through the main entrance and you’ll see the main staircase straight ahead. To the right of
    this is the statue of the horse and just behind that is a door - go through that and that’s the sign-in office. Now,
    on the first day you’ll be working in Gallery 1. You find t<span style="font-weight: 400;">his as follows ...
    </span><span class="explainq7 explain">in the central courtyard area, close to the entrance, there’s a large chest
      where visitors put donations for the museum. The door just behind that leads to Gallery 1</span><span
      style="font-weight: 400;">. The workshop you’ll be taking part in starts at eleven o’clock but if you want to go
      in earlier you can get the key and let yourself in. <span class="explainq8 explain">The key box is quite hard to
        find. Walk behind Reception and it’s between the large gallery and the bookshop.</span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I haven’t mentioned breaks, lunch etc. Unfortunately our cafe’s closed at the
      moment so your best bet is to bring a packed lunch. We tend to have our sandwiches in <span
        class="explainq9 explain">the kitchen area ... go round the reception desk and you’ll see a small circular
        cabinet - the door to the kitchen area is just behind that.</span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now everyday, we put up notices about what’s happening in the museum. Your
      supervisor will brief you but if you want to check up on details, look on our <span
        class="explainq10 explain">staff noticeboard. This is in the corner of the play area - at the back, on the wall
        of Gallery 3.</span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have any questions, I’d be happy to ...</span></p>
