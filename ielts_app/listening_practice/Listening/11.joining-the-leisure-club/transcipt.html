    On behalf of LP Clubs, I’d like to welcome you all here today. My name’s
    Sandy Fisher and I'm one of the fitness managers here. Before we start our
    tour of the club I'll just run through some basic information about the
    facilities we have here, including recent improvements, and explain the
    types of membership available.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our greatest asset is probably our
    <span class="explainq1 explain"
      >swimming pool which at 25 metres isn't Olympic-sized. but now we've
      expanded it to eight lanes, it’s much wider</span
    >&nbsp;This means there are rarely more than a couple of people at a time in
    each lane. Unfortunately, there isn’t space for an outdoor pool here but the
    glass roof on the swimming pool is partly retractable, which means you can
    enjoy something of the open-air experience on warmer days.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our
    <span class="explainq2 explain">recently refurbished fitness suite</span
    >&nbsp;has all the latest exercise equipment including ten&nbsp;new running
    machines, and a wide range of weight-training machines. Each member
    is&nbsp;given full training in how to operate the equipment and there is
    always a trainer on duty to&nbsp;offer help and advice. Although we do have
    adult-only times after 6 and at certain times&nbsp;at weekends, children are
    well catered for. Older children continue to benefit from a wide&nbsp;range
    of tuition; anything from trampolining&nbsp;to yoga.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    One thing all our members appreciate about us is that we take very good care
    of them. This starts on day one with your personal assessment. You are asked
    to fill in a questionnaire
    <span class="explainq3 explain">giving details of any health problems.</span
    >&nbsp;One of our personal trainers will then &nbsp;go through this with
    you.
  </p>
  <p>
    The trainer will then
    <span class="explainq4 explain">take you through the safety rules</span
    >&nbsp;for using the equipment in the fitness &nbsp;suite. During your next
    exercise session a personal trainer will work with you to make sure you
    understand these. It's very important to do this because we really do want
    to avoid&nbsp;having any sports injuries. There's a lot more to looking
    after yourself than simply lifting weights!
  </p>
  <p>
    At the end of the personal assessment,
    <span class="explainq5 explain"
      >the trainer will draw up a plan, outlining what you should try to achieve
      within a six-week period</span
    >. This will then be reviewed at the end of the six weeks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, I’ll just quickly run through the types of membership we have
    available.
    <span class="explainq6 explain"
      >All members must pav a joining fee of £90</span
    >&nbsp;in addition to the rates for the monthly membership fees.
    <span class="explainq7 explain"
      >Gold membership entitles you to free entry at all LP Clubs</span
    >. There are now LP clubs in all major cities and towns so if you travel a
    lot this will be a great advantage. Individual gold membership costs £50 a
    month and joint membership for you and your partner will cost £75.
  </p>
  <p>
    Premier membership is for professional people whose work commitments make it
    difficult for them to use the club during the day and so
    <span class="explainq8 explain"
      >LP gives booking preferences to Premier members at peak times</span
    >. This means you will find it easier to book the sessions at times that
    suit you. Reciprocal arrangements with other LP Clubs are available to
    Premier members. Premier membership is for individuals only,
    <span class="explainq9 explain"
      >but&nbsp;you will be sent passes for quests every month</span
    >. The monthly fee is £65.
  </p>
  <p>
    You don’t have to have any special clothes or equipment when you visit the
    club. We provide robes and hairdryers in the changing rooms, but
    <span class="explainq10 explain"
      >it’s very important to remember your photo card</span
    >&nbsp;because you won’t be able to get in without it.
  </p>
  <p>For people who aren’t working during the day then ...&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
