    <p>Hi, Laura - could you spare a few minutes to talk about the work placement you did last summer? I'm thinking of
        doing one myself... Hi, Tim. Sure.</p>
    <p>Didn’t you do yours at an environmental services company?</p>
    <p>That's right... It’s only a very small company and they needed&nbsp;someone to produce a company brochure, and I
        wanted to get some business experience because I’m interested in a career in occupational psychology in a
        business environment. It was good because I had overall responsibility for the project.</p>
    <p>What kind of skills do you think you developed on the placement? I mean, apart from the ones you already had ...
        Did you have to do all the artwork for the brochure, the layout and everything?</p>
    <p>We hired the services of a professional photographer for that. I did have to use my IT skills to a certain extent
        because I cut and pasted text from marketing leaflets, but that didn't involve anything I hadn’t done before.
    </p>
    <p><span class="explainq1 explain">&nbsp;Do you&nbsp;think you&nbsp;got any better at managing your time and
            prioritising things? You always used to sav you had trouble with that...&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span class="explainq2 explain">&nbsp;Oh. definitely. There was so much pressure to meet the project deadline.
            &nbsp;And I also got better at explaining things and asserting my opinions</span>, because I had to have
        weekly consultations with the marketing manager and give him a progress report.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It sounds as if you got a lot out of it then.</p>
    <p>Absolutely. It was really worthwhile ... But you know, the company benefited too ...</p>
    <p>Yes, they must have done. After all, if they’d used a professional advertising agency to produce their brochure
        instead of doing it in-house, presumably they'd have paid a lot more?</p>
    <p>Oh, yes. I worked it out - <span class="explainq3 explain">&nbsp;it would have been 250 per cent more.</span></p>
    <p>And I thought the end result was good, even though we did everything on site. <em>r</em> The company has quite a
        powerful computer and I managed to borrow some scanning software from the university. The new brochure looks
        really professional;<span class="explainq4 explain"> &nbsp;it enhances the image of the company straight
            away.</span></p>
    <p>So in the long run it should help them to attract clients, and improve their sales figures?</p>
    <p>That’s the idea. Yeah.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Well, all in all it sounds very positive - I think I will go ahead and apply for a placement myself. How do I go
        about it?</p>
    <p>It's easy enough to do, because there’s a government agency called STEP - S-T-E-P - that organises placements for
        students. You should start by getting their booklet with all the details - I expect you can download one from
        their website.</p>
    <p>Actually, <span class="explainq5 explain">they’ve got&nbsp;copies in the psychology department - I’ve seen them
            there. I'll just go to the office and pick one up.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>Right. And then if I were you, after I’d looked at it I'd go over all the options with someone ...</p>
    <p>I suppose I should ask my tutor’s advice. He knows more about me than anyone.</p>
    <p><span class="explainq6 explain">One of the career officers would be better</span>, they’ve got more knowledge
        about the jobs market than your personal tutor would have.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>OK ...</p>
    <p>And then when you know what you want you can register with STEP - you’ll find their address in the booklet. And
        once you’ve registered they assign you to a mentor who looks after your application.</p>
    <p>And then I suppose you just sit back and wait till you hear something? They told me at the careers office that
        it’s best to be proactive, and <span class="explainq7 explain">get updates yourself by checking the website for
            new placement alerts.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>Your mentor is supposed to keep you informed, but you can't rely on that.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I don’t suppose it’s a good idea to get in touch with companies directly, is&nbsp;it?</p>
    <p>Not really ... <span class="explainq8 explain">But it is the company who notifies you&nbsp;if they want you
            to&nbsp;go&nbsp;for an interview. You get a letter of invitation or an email from personnel
            departments.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span class="explainq9 explain">And do I reply directly to them?</span></p>
    <p>Yes, you&nbsp;do&nbsp;STEP only gets involved again once you've been made a&nbsp;job offer.</p>
    <p>TIM: Right... So. once you’ve had an interview you&nbsp;should let your&nbsp;mentor&nbsp;know what the outcome
        is? I mean whether you’re offered a job, and whether you’ve decided to accept it?&nbsp;</p>
    <p>That’s right. They'll inform the careers office once a placement has been&nbsp;agreed, so you don’t have to do
        that.</p>
    <p>Is that all then?</p>
    <p>More or less. Only once you’ve accepted an offer you’ll probably have to&nbsp;supply a reference, because the
        placement will be conditional on that.</p>
    <p><span class="explainq10 explain">And that’s something you&nbsp;should ask your&nbsp;own tutor to
            provide.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>He knows about your academic ability and also about your qualities, like reliability.</p>
    <p>Well, thanks very much for the information - I’m starting to look forward ...</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
