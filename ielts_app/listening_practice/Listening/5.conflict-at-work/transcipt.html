                    <p>Over the years, attitudes towards workers have changed considerably. After ail, there was a time
                        when workers had no rights at all, and laboured in appalling conditions. Conditions have
                        improved a lot, but conflict in the workplace is still common. And human resources managers
                        nowadays need to be able to deal with it when necessary.</p>
                    <p><span class="explainq1 explain">What is conflict in the workplace? Definitions vary, but I’m
                            taking it to refer to a whole range of behaviours that the victim finds unacceptable, from
                            minor, harmless arguments to at the opposite extreme - physical violence. Much of this is
                            covered by the term bullying</span>, by which I mean one or more people behaving abusively
                        or aggressively against another who is in a weaker position. Although all behaviour like this is
                        a form of conflict, not ail conflict can be<br>described in these terms.</p>
                    <p>As with all human behaviour, there are numerous reasons for it. But <span
                            class="explainq2 explain">often it’s caused by someone who feels the need to show their
                            superiority over someone else</span>, in order to feel that they aren’t at the lowest level
                        in a hierarchy or a group of people.</p>
                    <p><span class="explainq3 explain">In some cases one person simply dislikes the other, on the basis
                            that the personality of one is in some way incompatible with that of the other
                            person</span>. A general habit of optimism in one person could make them intolerant of a
                        colleague who’s constantly pessimistic - not that that justifies treating them badly, of course.
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="explainq4 explain">Some conflicts arise when people are more interested in promoting
                            themselves and their team than in the company as a whole. These conflicts are called
                            ‘structural'</span>, and could come about, for example, when a sales team believe they are
                        the only people in the business who do any useful work, and look down on behind-the-scenes
                        administrators.</p>
                    <p><span class="explainq5 explain">Conflict obviously affects the individuals concerned - the
                            situation is likely to be very stressful for victims, resulting in their absence from work,
                            possibly for months</span>. For the company, if no effort is made to deal with conflict, it
                        can spiral out of control, and even lead to the breakdown of the business.</p>
                    <p>Some interesting work with chief executives - CEOs - has uncovered some of the reasons why they
                        may treat colleagues badly. <span class="explainq6 explain">Many CEOs combine two opposing
                            characteristics: confidence - that is, the belief that they’re capable of great achievements
                            - with a high level of anxiety</span>, a fear of missing targets, whether set by themselves
                        or by the directors of the company. This combination can make them respond badly to anyone who
                        questions their decisions.</p>
                    <p>In a high pressure work environment, such characteristics become problematic. And <span
                            class="explainq7 explain">it’s particularly difficult to tackle the situation where
                            colleagues, managers and board members are all trying to achieve their own visions. When
                            they can’t agree on strategic issues and on where they see the business going, there are
                            real problems</span>.</p>
                    <p>For managers at lower levels within the organisation, it might seem that an autocratic form of
                        management - where the chief executive gives orders and everyone else has to obey - would see
                        more conflict than others. Interestingly. though, <span class="explainq8 explain">a company with
                            a more democratic business model, can suffer more, when uncertainty about who to report to
                            leads to conflicting demands</span>.</p>
                    <p>Now I’ll say a little about dealing with the type of conflict that has harmful effects. Of course
                        the ideal is to prevent it arising in the first place. <span class="explainq9 explain">A good
                            manager. at any level, will make efforts to earn the respect of the people they work
                            with</span>, particularly those who report to them. That will involve politeness in all
                        communications, and treating them as equals who happen to have a different role within the
                        organisation.</p>

                <td>
                    <p>Sometimes, of course, conflict does occur, and can get out of hand. In such cases the human
                        resources department often gets involved. However, <span class="explainq10 explain">if one of
                            the parties in a conflict sees human resources as simply a mouthpiece for the chief
                            executive, then an external mediator might be able to help</span>. by talking to both sides,
                        and trying to find the truth of what's been happening, they can build a clear picture of the
                        situation, and give feedback that both sides will accept, precisely because they’re independent.
