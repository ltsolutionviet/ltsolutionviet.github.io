  <h2>Radio presenter:</h2>
  <p>Well, last week we talked about buying camping equipment and today I’d like to talk to you about buying a bicycle.
    A simple &nbsp;enough exercise, you might imagine,&nbsp;but there are lots of things to look out for to make sure
    you get the best deal for&nbsp;your money.</p>
  <p style="padding: 0pt 85pt 0pt 0pt;">Well, the range of bicycles is enormous — there are racing bikes, touring bikes,
    <span class="explainq1 explain">mountain bikes</span> or just plain ordinary bikes for riding round town. They
    vary&nbsp;enormously in two basic ways: price and <span class="explainq2 explain">quality</span>. This means that
    the choice you&nbsp;make will probably be determined by the amount of money you want to pay, your own personal
    needs, what is actually available or a compromise of all three things.</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">However, in broad terms you can spend anything from $50 to <span
      class="explainq3 explain">$2.000</span> on a bike so,&nbsp;you’ll need to know what you are looking for.</p>
  <p style="padding: 0pt 85pt 0pt 0pt;">Single speed cycles — that is bikes with no gears, are really only suited to
    <span class="explainq4 explain">short-casual rides</span>. Their attraction is their simplicity and reliability.
    After years of&nbsp;neglect they still manage to function, though not always too efficiently. If it’s basic
    transport you’re after then you can’t go wrong.</p>
  <p>Three speed cycles on the other hand are all that is really necessary for most&nbsp;town riding,<span
      class="explainq5 explain"> going to the shops and things like that</span>. Like the single speed bike&nbsp;they
    are simple and reliable. If you are going to be going up and down lots of&nbsp;hills, then you’ll probably want
    something more efficient.</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">Five and ten speed bicycles are best suited to riding over long distances or
    hilly&nbsp;terrain and to <span class="explainq6 explain">serious touring</span>, so if it’s serious touring you’re
    interested <span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">in, get a five&nbsp;</span><span
      style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">or ten speed bike.</span> However it’s worth remembering
    that the<span class="explainq7 explain"> difference in price&nbsp;between a five and ten speed cycle is usually very
      little</span> and so it’s well worth&nbsp;paying that little bit extra to get the ten speed one. So I would tend
    to recommend&nbsp;the ten speed bike as <span class="explainq8 explain">the price is similar</span> — however you’ll
    be getting better&nbsp;quality components.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">Now the next thing we need to look at is size. Buying a cycle is like <span
      class="explainq9 explain">buying&nbsp;clothes</span>, first of all you find the right size and then you try it on
    to see if it fits.&nbsp;Contrary to what you might imagine, the size of the cycle is not determined by the&nbsp;size
    of the wheels (except in children’s cycles), but by the size of the <span class="explainq10 explain">frame</span>.
    So&nbsp;you’ll need to measure the length of your legs and arms to get a frame that is the&nbsp;right size for you.
