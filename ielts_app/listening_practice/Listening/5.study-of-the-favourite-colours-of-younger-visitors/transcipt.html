    <p>Now while the exhibition's been running, the organisers have carried out a study of the favourite colours of
        their younger visitors. Over 2.600 children have responded to this, and there were lots and lots of colours to
        choose from, so the scores weren't high for each individual colour, even if the colours were - like blue - of
        average popularity. Clearly, the bold colours were the winners. Though purple, which I would have expected to be
        a high scorer, had just 1.73% of the votes, unlike <span class="explainq1 explain">deep pink</span>, which came
        next to top. In the middle ground along with purple - which was still pretty popular compared to others - was
        lime green - the first shade of green to be anywhere near the top. One two-year-old commented that <span
            class="explainq2 explain">red</span> was die only colour she knew, which is perhaps why that was more
        popular with children than anything else Needless to say, all the tans and beiges came near the bottom. In fact,
        the lighter the colours, the less popular they were - even the light pinks.</p>
    <p>So why did the kids go for these striking colours? As adults, it's all about clothes what we think suits us or is
        fashionable. But these youngsters are <span class="explainq3 explain">looking outward more and they go for
            colours that hit them that they pick out over and above the rest</span>. It's less to do with how they feel
        - whether it calms them down or whatever - and more about immediate impact. And. of course, <span
            class="explainq4 explain">there are associations with football</span> that led a lot of both boys and girls
        to go for particular colours - in fact, more children seemed to comment on this than anything else, whereas
        adults would be more likely to go for something worn by someone they really like. So. all in all. it says a lot
        about.</p>
