    Harnessing the Sun’s energy - that is, using the sun to generate power - can
    be difficult, but these days increasing use is being made of the energy from
    the sun, particularly to heat homes and provide hot water. Have a look at
    this diagram, which represents solar panels fixed to the roof of a house. It
    is typical of any system which uses a
    <span class="explainq1 explain">solar panel</span> to provide hot water.

    So how does it work? Well... energy from the Sun travels to the Earth in the
    form of radiation. This can be visible radiation - which is another way of
    saying ‘light’. We also receive invisible radiation, which is known as infra
    red. A lot of this radiation passes through the glass at the front of the
    solar panel - here on the roof - and hits the surface at the back. This
    surface is black, because black is good at absorbing radiation, and so the
    black surface becomes hot. Energy in the form of heat is conducted along the
    back of the solar panel to these
    <span class="explainq2 explain">copper pipes</span>. Now... these pipes are
    filled with a liquid which in turn becomes hot. This can be either
    <span class="explainq3 explain">oil or water</span>, though oil is usually
    used. The oil expands and rises up the pipe into the energy exchanger, which
    is located - up here - in the
    <span class="explainq4 explain">water tank</span>. Sometimes we have to use
    a <span class="explainq5 explain">pump</span> as well, to help the liquid
    along. It’s a remarkably efficient system, when you think about it.
