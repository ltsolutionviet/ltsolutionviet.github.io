          <p><span class="explainq1 explain">So I thought I’d start with Giannetti. who’s a professor of film and
              literature, and in one of his books he came up with a straightforward classification of film adaptations
              based on how faithful they are to the original plays and novels.</span></p>

              Shakespeare adaptations that they’ve seen, and to say why</span>. That should be more fun than having
            their favourite versions.</p>

          <p>Right. Next I want to talk about Rachel Malchow. I came across something on the&nbsp;internet about her
            work on film adaptations, and I was thinking of showing some film clips to illustrate her ideas.</p>

          <p>That’s right. <span class="explainq5 explain">It was a very loose adaptation, using the same situation and
              story. but moving it to 16th century Japan instead of 16th century Britain.</span> So for example the
            king’s daughters become sons, because in Japanese culture at that time, women couldn’t succeed to the
            throne.</p>

          <p>OK. I hope you’re going to talk about the1993 film of Much Ado About Nothing, I think that’s one of the
            best Shakespeare films. It really brings the play to life, doesn’t it?</p>
