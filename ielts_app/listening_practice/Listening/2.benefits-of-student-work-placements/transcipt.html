    <h2>Benefits of student work placements</h2>

  <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will hear two engineering students, a woman in her sixth year called Linda
        and a man in his fifth year called Matthew, discussing the benefits of student work
        placements.&nbsp;</span></em></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hi Linda. Can you spare a few minutes?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hello Matthew, no problem.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I just wanted to talk to you about temporary work placements ... I’ve never really
      thought there was a good reason for doing one. I’ve got some savings, so I don’t really need the money at the
      moment. But <span class="explainq1 explain">I’ve had an email from the university about a vacancy that looks quite
        interesting</span>. You did a placement last year didn’t you?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I did, yes. In my case I wanted to find out if I was making the right career choice
      before I began applying for permanent jobs. I thought I wanted to work in car manufacturing but I wasn’t sure. So
      I applied to Toyota.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What was the application process like?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lengthy. There were a lot of different parts to it. The dullest one was a
      psychometric test - you know, when you have to answer loads of questions about yourself.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And you’re trying to guess what’s the best thing to say!</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes. Then <span class="explainq2 explain">there was an activity that we did in
        groups, which I found really fascinating</span>. Engineers are renowned for being a bit unsociable, but I
      thought we made a great team.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And we had an individual task too. We had to sort through various business
      documents and prioritise them. It was just like what you have to do as a student really, just with different
      content.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What exactly were you doing on the placement?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was helping to design some diagnostic software to identify any waste in the car
      assembly process</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you mean waste of materials?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, time. <span class="explainq3 explain">Anything that can speed the process
        up</span> helps to cut costs.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How did the work placement compare to being a student? Was it hard work?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, it was. I’d had full-time work before - I’ve done various unskilled jobs
      during university holidays, and some of those involved long hours - so I thought I’d find it easy. I was wrong
      though. I think <span class="explainq4 explain">when you’re on placement you’re always trying to prove yourself
        .</span>..</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So you push yourself hard to succeed?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes. But I got a lot of support from my employers. They were always helpful. And
      then at the end of the placement I was given formal feedback.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you mean on your engineering ability?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, no, I didn’t really need that because we had team meetings every other day,
      and so I had the chance to discuss technical issues and ask about anything that wasn’t clear. The evaluation was
      about general workplace things, like <span class="explainq5 explain">organisational ability</span>, initiative ...
      That sort of thing ...</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I get the impression you think you benefited from the placement ... ?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well the best thing is that <span class="explainq6 explain">they’ve offered me a
        job</span> for next year! Depending on my exam results of course, but still ...</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A permanent one?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes! But apart from that I learned so much . The industrial environment was much
      more demanding than the academic one, so my general skills improved. Like time Management ... meeting deadlines
      ... And on the technical side I learned new software packages like MS Project.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I think you’ve convinced me that work placements are worthwhile ... But while
      you’re&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">here can you give me advice on something else?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m about to make a start on the Engineering Materials module, and I’ve got a
      booklist here - can you have a quick look and tell me what you would recommend - that’s if you can
      remember?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s see ... I do remember some of them ... Yes, this one ... <span
        class="explainq7 explain">The Science of Materials</span>. I found the subject quite hard generally,</span> but
    this book is very accessible so it suited me.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> It doesn’t cover everything though
      ...</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What about this one then . <span class="explainq8 explain">Materials
        Engineering</span>?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh yes, I do remember that. But it’s a bit out-of-date now isn’t it, unless it’s a
      new edition?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t think so ...</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what I liked about it were the pic</span>tures. They really helped to
    understand the descriptions. It’<span style="font-weight: 400;">s useful just from that point of view ... Let’s see
      ... What else? Oh yes ... That one there - <span class="explainq9 explain">Engineering Basics</span> - I think out
      of all these that’s got the</span> widest coverage ...</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I’ve looked at the contents page, and it hardly mentions nanotechnology.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, you’re right. The <span class="explainq10 explain">Evolution of
        Materials</span> does though. It’s a recent publication so </span>it covers all the latest developments. It’s a
    bit thin on the nineteen sixties though, and that decade was quite important.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well it sounds as if they all complement each other in some ways. I don’t suppose
      you can lend me .</span></p>
