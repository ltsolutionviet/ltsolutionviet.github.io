  <p>Good morning, and welcome to the museum - one with a remarkable range of exhibits, which I’m sure you’ll enjoy. My
    name’s Greg, and I’ll tell you about the various collections as we go&nbsp;round. But before we go, let me just give
    you a taste of what we have here.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Well, for one thing, we have a fine collection of <span class="explainq1 explain">twentieth and twenty-first
      century paintings,</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>many by very well-known artists. I’m sure you’ll recognise several of the paintings. This is the gallery that
    attracts the largest number of visitors, so it’s best to go in early in the day before&nbsp;the crowds arrive.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Then there are the <span class="explainq2 explain">nineteenth-century paintings</span>. The museum was opened in
    the middle of</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>that century and several of the artists each donated one work&nbsp;to get the museum started, as it were. So
    they’re of special interest to us - we feel closer to them than to other works.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The <span class="explainq3 explain">sculpture</span> gallery has a number of fine exhibits, but I'm afraid it's
    currently closed for</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>refurbishment. You’ll need to come back next year to see it properly. but a number of the sculptures have been
    moved to other parts of the museum.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span class="explainq4 explain">‘Around the world'</span> is a temporary exhibition - you've probably seen
    something about it on TV or in the newspapers. It's created a great deal of interest, because it presents objects
    from&nbsp;every continent and many countries, and provides information about their social context -why they were
    made, who for, and so on.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Then there’s the collection of <span class="explainq5 explain">coins</span>. This is what you might call a focused,
    specialist collection, because all the coins come from this country, and were produced between two</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>thousand and a thousand years ago. And many of them were discovered by ordinary people digging their gardens, and
    donated to the museum!</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>All our <span class="explainq6 explain">porcelain and glass</span> was left to the museum by its founder, when he
    died in 1878. And in the terms of his will, we’re not allowed to add anything to that collection: he believed it
    was&nbsp;perfect in itself, and we don’t see any reason to disagree!</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>OK, that was something about the collections, and now here s some more practical information, in case you need it.
    Most of the museum facilities are downstairs, in the&nbsp;basement, so you go down the stairs here. When you reach
    the bottom of the stairs, you'll&nbsp;find yourself in a sitting area, with comfortable chairs and sofas where you
    can have a rest&nbsp;before continuing your exploration of the museum.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>We have a very good <span class="explainq7 explain">restaurant</span>, which serves excellent food all day, in a
    relaxing</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>atmosphere. To reach it, when you get to the bottom of the stairs, go straight ahead to the far side of the sitting
    area, then turn right into the corridor. You'll see the door of the restaurant facing you</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If you just want a snack, or if you'd like to eat somewhere with facilities for children, we also</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>have a <span class="explainq8 explain">café</span>. When you reach the bottom of the stairs, you'll need to go
    straight ahead, turn, right into the corridor, and the café is immediately on the right.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>And talking about children, there are <span class="explainq9 explain">baby-changing facilities downstairs: cross
      the sitting area, continue straight ahead along the corridor on the left, and you and your baby will find&nbsp;the
      facilities on the left-hand side.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The <span class="explainq10 explain">cloakroom</span>, where you should leave coats, umbrellas and any large bags,
    is on the left hand side of the sitting area. It's through the last door before you come to the corridor.</p>
  <p>There are toilets on every floor, but in the basement they're the first rooms on the left when you get down there.
  </p>
  <p>OK, now if you’ve got anything to leave in the cloakroom, please do that now, and then we’ll start our tour.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
