            OK, Stewart. We need to start planning our paper on public
            libraries. Have you thought of an angle yet?

            Weil, there’s so much we could look into. How libraries have changed
            over the centuries, for instance, or how different countries
            organise them. What do you think, Trudie?

              local population may speak lots of different languages.</span

            Yes, but remember we’re only supposed to write a short paper, so
            it’s probably best if we don’t go into funding in any detail.

            OK. We obviously need to look at the impact of new technology,
            particularly the&nbsp;internet. Now that lots of books have been
            digitalised, people can access them from their own computers at
            home.

            Anyway, I find it hard to concentrate when I’m reading a long text
            on a screen. I’d much rather read a physical book. And it takes
            longer to read on a screen.

            Mm. I expect that libraries will go on evolving in the next few
            years, Some have &nbsp;already become centres where community
            activities take place, like local clubs meeting there. I think
            that’ll become even more common.

            I’d like to think so, and that they’ll still be serving their
            traditional&nbsp;function, but I’m not so sure. There are financial
            implications, after all.

            I’ve just had an idea. Why don’t we make an in-depth study of our
            local public library as background to our paper?

            Yes, that’d be interesting, and raise all sorts of issues. Let’s
            make a list of possible things we could ask about, then work out
            some sort of structure.
            <span class="explainq4 explain"

            And what their policies are. I know they don’t allow food, but I’d
            love to find out what types of noise they ban - there always seems
            to be a lot of talking, but never music. I don’t know if that’s a
            policy or it just happens.
