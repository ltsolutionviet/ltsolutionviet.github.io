  <p><strong>Announcer: </strong>And now for some information on local events and activities. A couple of announcements
    for art- lovers and budding artists alike. First, a new collection of artwork is going on show to the public next
    month in the form of an artists' exhibition. The exhibition will include many different types of art ... over 100
    different pieces, by 58 artists from the local area. <span class="explainq1 explain">It's being held at the Royal
      Museum</span> which - for those of you who are unfamiliar with the area - is located opposite the library in West
    Street, right on the corner... <span class="explainq2 explain">the actual address is number 1. Queen's Park
      Road</span> - it isn't difficult to find. The exhibition will run for 9 weeks and will begin on the 6th of October
    <span class="explainq3 explain">and continue until the 10th December.</span> So there's plenty of time for you to go
    along and have a look and I'm sure that will be worth doing.</p>
  <p>What will you see there? Well, amongst the items on display will be some exciting pieces of modern jewellery,
    furniture, ceramics, <span class="explainq4 explain">metal work</span> and sculpture. To give you some examples ...
    Local artist Kate Maine will be there to discuss her collection of pots and bowls <span
      class="explainq5 explain">that she has made to resemble garden vegetables</span>. They're the sort of thing that
    would brighten up any dining table, and range from things like yellow cabbage-shaped bowls to round tomato­shaped
    teapots. Prize-winner Cynthia Course, will also be there to talk about her silver jewellery, all of which she
    produced using ideas from the rural setting of her country home. Some of her rings are quite extraordinary <span
      class="explainq6 explain">and have beautiful coloured stones in them</span>. Or if you prefer sculpture, there's
    plenty of that too. Take, for example, Susan Cup's sculpture of <span class="explainq7 explain">25 pairs of white
      paper </span>shoes. It sounds easy, but believe me it looks incredible! All of these items along with many others
    will be on sale-throughout the exhibition period.</p>
  <p>As part of the exhibition, there will be <span class="explainq8 explain">a series of demonstrations called 'Face to
      Face'</span> which will take place every Sunday afternoon during the exhibition and these will provide an
    opportunity for you to meet the artists.</p>
  <p>The second set of activities are for those who would prefer to indulge in some artwork themselves ... the Artist's
    Conservatory are holding a series of courses over the autumn period. The courses cover all media and include
    subjects such as Chinese brush painting, <span class="explainq9 explain">pencil drawing </span>and silk painting.
    All the tutors are experienced artists, course sizes are kept to a minimum of 15 and there will be plenty of
    individual assistance.</p>
  <p>All the sessions offer excellent value for money and the opportunity to relax in a delightful rural setting. Fees
    are very reasonable and include the use of an excellent studio and access to the art shop which you will find sells
    everything from paper to CDs and they also include the <span class="explainq10 explain">provision of all
      materials</span>. For more information on dates, cost and availability you should get in touch with the programme
    co-ordinator on 4592 839584 or go direct to the website ...</p>
