    <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will hear a woman, called Tanya, talking to her friend, called Simon, who
                lives abroad. Tanya is planning to visit Simon. </span></em></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hello.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hi, is that Tanya?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes ... Simon ... lovely to hear you! How are you?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Very well ... and we’re so looking forward to seeing you.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So am I.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now I don’t have a lot of time, I’m afraid, so I wanted to make sure we’ve got
            all your details. Have you confirmed your flights?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes I’m definitely coming on the twenty second of June.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excellent. Have you got your flight number?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not with me, I’m afraid, but I promise I’ll email it ... let me make a note of
            all this.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, do, because one of us’ll try to come and collect you from the airport, if we
            can. I presume you’ll be coming into <span class="explainq1 explain">Terminal</span> One?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aggh ... I don’t know ... I’ll have to find out which one it is ...</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes ... you must ... we don’t want to be waiting at the wrong one!</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But hang on ... I’ll be arriving at about lunch time ... and that’ll mean you
            have to take time off work to pick me up. You really mustn’t do that.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look ... we’re not all that busy at work and if there’s a problem I can text you
            when you arrive and you can take a taxi.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OK .</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a really good company called <span
                class="explainq2 explain">Pantera</span>.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can you spell that?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s P-A-N-T-E-R-A. They have a stand at the airport ... you can’t miss it ...
            and they’re really reliable.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great, thanks ... how far are you from the airport?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About forty minutes.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And you’re near the city centre, aren’t you?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re <span class="explainq3 explain">East</span> of it actually ... don’t tell
            the driver city centre because you’ll really get caught up in traffic!</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tanya: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span
            style="font-weight: 400;">OK! And I’ll make sure I carry your address with me. Now have you got my mobile
            ... um ...&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cell phone number?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simon: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span
            style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, you sent it last month.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tanya: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span
            style="font-weight: 400;">But I tell you what ... I don’t think I’ve got yours ... I’d better have it now,
            just in case.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simon: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span
            style="font-weight: 400;">OK ... and I changed it recently anyway. Ready? It’s </span><span
            class="explainq4 explain">zero seven seven six five, three two&nbsp;eight, four double one.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks. Now, what should I pack ... ?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, all the usual ... casual clothes mainly. Though you’d better bring an
            evening dress. We’ll be having at least one fancy dinner at a <span class="explainq5 explain">hotel</span>
            restaurant.</span></p>
    <p>Now, when you’re coming, unfortunately the weather’s not going to be brilliant.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know, it’s the rainy season ... I’m bringing an umbrella.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have tons of those ... so don’t pack one, but pack a <span
                class="explainq6 explain">raincoat</span> . a good one ‘cause we’ll try and get out for plenty of
            hikes.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OK, sure. Sounds super ... just what I love. And I’d better remember to pack my
            sturdy walking <span class="explainq7 explain">shoes</span>.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excellent idea ... it’s pretty rugged round here ... so they have to be
            tough!</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can imagine. I’m so looking forward to getting out. Oh Simon, before I forget,
            you recommended I read a book about your area .</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What was the name again? I’d like to read it ... to get an idea of the history,
            etc.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s called ‘<span class="explainq8 explain">Mountain Lives</span>’ and it’s
            ...</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hang on ... I’m just writing it down ... OK.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">... and it’s by Rex Campbell.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great, I’ll try and get hold of that.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well worth it.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now the really important things are gifts.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh don’t worry about that . just bring yourself .</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know but I’d like to get something for your parents. What about Janice ... I
            know she loves English tea.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s very kind ... but she’s not drinking so much of that these days. But she’d
            love some <span class="explainq9 explain">chocolate</span> ... you know her favourite.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh yes ... that’d be nice ... I’ll do that. And Alec? Is he still into
            racing?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Very much so.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was thinking of bringing a <span class="explainq10 explain">calendar</span> ...
            you know, with horse-racing pictures.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What a good idea ... he’d love that ...</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great . so that’s about it I think.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, I think so . so you’ll send me your number .</span></p>
