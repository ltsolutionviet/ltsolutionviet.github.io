    </div>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinder’s Animal Park. Hello?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, hello, I’m ringing to ask whether you have any jobs available...</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah, what sort of work are you looking for? Is that permanent, or part time or
            ...</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually I’m just looking for <span class="explainqe explain">temporary</span>
            work. I’m a student.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh right. I’ll just get a form, and ask you a few questions.</span>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I’ll pass your application on to our recruitment section. Is that OK?</span>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fine, thank you.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, starting with your name .</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s Jane <span class="explainq1 explain">Lamerton</span></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is that L-A-double M-E-R-T-O-N?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s only one M in it.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, right. And your address?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s <span class="explainq2 explain">forty-two West Lane</span>.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right ... And is that in Exeter?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>And can you give me your mobile phone number? oh double seven nine two, four three oh nine two one.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right. Now, the next thing is, when are you available to start work?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I finish college on the eighth of <span class="explainq3 explain">June</span>,
            that’s in three weeks’ time, but I can’t start work till the <span class="explainq3 explain">eleventh</span>
            because I’ve got a hospital appointment on the tenth of June.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No problem. Now I need to ask you a few questions about the type of job that
            might be suitable. Do you have any particular kind of work in mind? It doesn’t necessarily mean that you
            will get work in the field that you want, but I can record your preferences.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well I’d do anything, and I have worked as an assistant animal keeper before,
            when I was still at school. But I’m studying at a catering college now, and I’d really like to get some
            experience as an assistant <span class="explainq4 explain">cook</span> if possible.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right. So that’s your first choice. Have you done that kind of job before?</span>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No. But I’ve helped my aunt sometimes - she runs a cafe in Exeter.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mmm. Would you say you’ve got any relevant skills then?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well I’m used to using the kind of <span
                class="explainq5 explain">equipment</span> you usually find in a kitchen.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OK . And I know you’re still studying, but do you already have any qualifications
            related to that kind of work? A hygiene qualification, for example?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I haven’t, no, but I’ve got a certificate in <span
                class="explainq6 explain">food-handling</span>. I did it before I decided to become a full-time
            student.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fine. OK. That means you wouldn’t need any specific training if you did get the
            kind of work you wanted. But you’d have to do a short course on <span class="explainq7 explain">First
                Aid</span>. All our new employees do that. It just takes half a day, and most people find it generally
            useful.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh yes, I’m sure it is.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well that’s about it, really. Just one last thing - can you give me the name of
            someone who would give you a reference? Like a previous employer or ...</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh yes, you can put Dr Ruth Price.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OK ... Is that one of your college lecturers?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s my college <span class="explainq8 explain">tutor</span>. She’s known me for
            over two years, and I’m sure she wouldn’t mind. In fact she’s given me a reference before.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fine. We’d probably contact her by phone - do you happen to know her
            number?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve got it on my phone - yes - it’s <span class="explainq9 explain">oh two oh
                eight, six eight five, double one four</span>. That’s a landline.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good. Well. As I say, I can’t promise anything, but I’ll pass your application on
            and you should hear in a few days. Is there anything else?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just one thing - I suffer from a particular type of <span
                class="explainq10 explain">colour blindness</span>, and sometimes employers have to make special
            arrangements for that.</span></p>
    <p>I’ll make a note of that. It won’t be a problem, but it’s good that you’ve made us aware of it. You can provide
        us with more details if you are offered a job.</p>
    <p>Thanks very much. Bye.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bye.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
