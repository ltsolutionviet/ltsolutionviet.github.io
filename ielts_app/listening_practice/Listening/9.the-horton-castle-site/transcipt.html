          <p>Dave, I’m worried about our case study. I’ve done a bit of reading, but I’m not sure what’s involved in
            actually writing a case study - I missed the lecture where Dr Baker talked us through it.</p>

          <p>OK, well it’s quite straightforward. We’ve got our focus - that’s tourism at the Horton Castle site. And

          <p>Yes, both those groups. So we’ll have to go to the site to do that, I suppose. But we might also do some of
            our interviewed away from the site - <span class="explainq3 explain">we could even contact some people here

          <p>Then the case study itself is mostly quite standard; we begin by presenting the problem, and giving some
            background, then go through the main sections, but the thing that surprised me is that <span
              class="explainq6 explain">in a normal report we’d end with some suggestions to deal with the problem or
              need we identified, but in a case study we end up with a question or a series of questions to our readers,
              and they decide what ought to be done.</span></p>

          <p>So basically, the problem we’re addressing in our case study of the Horton Castle site is why so few
            tourists are visiting it. And we’ll find out more from our interviews, but I did find one report on the
            internet that suggested that one reason might be because as far as transport goes, access is difficult.</p>

          <p>I read that too, but that report was actually written ten years ago, when the road there was really bad.
            but that’s been improved now. And <span class="explainq7 explain">I think there’s plenty of fascinating
              stuff there for a really good day out. but you’d never realise it from the castle website - maybe that’s

            school parties or retired people, but I think we’d have to talk to staff to get that information.</p>

              all get out as fast as they can to get jobs in the city. and the only people left are children and those

          <p>Right. Something else we could investigate would be the potential damage that tourists might cause to the
            castle site, I mean their environmental impact. At present the tourists can just wander round wherever they
            want, <span class="explainq10 explain">but if numbers increase, there might have to be some restrictions,
              like sticking to marked ways. And there’d need to be guides and wardens around to make sure these were
