          <p>First I suggest you avoid taking one writer and going into a great deal of detail. That approach certainly
            has its place. but <span class="explainq5 explain">I think you first need to get an understanding of the
              literature in the context of the society in which it was produced - who it was written for. how it was
              published, and so on</span>. I also think that’s more fruitful than placing it within the history of the
            genre.</p>

          <p>Well, <span class="explainq6 explain">what I suggest is that you read an assignment a student wrote last
