        <p><strong>Note</strong>: This is<strong> only Kate</strong>. Martin isn't going to conduct interviews; he is
            going to type them up after Kate has done the <span style="color: #0000ff;">'face-to-face
                stage</span>'.&nbsp;</p>

            style="text-decoration: underline;">run through statistics programmes</span><span class="font5">, won't
            they? That's where I always feel a bit unsure about&nbsp;which tests are the correct ones to choose.</span>

    <p><span class="font5">Martin: Same here. But we can get advice from the lecturers about that. </span><span
            class="font5" style="text-decoration: underline;">Shall we do all that as a <span

    <p><span class="font5">Kate: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration: underline;">I
            think<span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;"> it'd make us feel more secure about what

                style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;">were doing</span>.</span></p>
    <div style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid black; background-color: #dddddd;"><strong>Note:</strong> Martin and
        Kate will analyse the statistics - 'run (the results) through statistics programmes' - <strong><span

    <p><span class="font5">Martin: Yes, it would be terrible to get that wrong after all the hard work leading up to
            it.</span></p>
    <p><span class="font5">Kate: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then we've got to present the whole thing to
            the&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">group. Will you feel up to doing that?</span></p>
    <p><span class="font5">Martin: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should do a <span style="color: #ff0000;">joint
                presentation.</span> It's all both our&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">work, after all.</span></p>
    <p><span class="font5">Kate: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess you're right. But </span><span
            class="explainq10 explain">would you mind getting the&nbsp;slides and so on ready?</span> <span
            class="font5">I find that takes me ages, and still doesn't look any good.</span></p>
    <p><span class="font5">Martin: Whereas I quite enjoy that kind of thing. </span><span class="font5"

    <div style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid black; background-color: #dddddd;"><strong>Note:</strong> It's
        important here to distinguish between giving the presentation (which the question does not ask about) and <span
            style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>preparing visuals for the presentation</strong> </span>(which the question
        does ask about). Martin and Kate will give the presentation together (<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>'a
                joint presentation</strong></span>'), but<span style="color: #0000ff;"> only Martin</span> will make
        'the slides and so on'</div>
