  <p>Thorndyke’s.</p>
  <p>Good morning. Is that Mr Thorndyke?</p>
  <p>Speaking. How can I help?</p>
  <p>I’ve got quite a few things which need painting and fixing in the flat and I&nbsp;wonder whether you'd be able to
    do the work.</p>
  <p>I’m sure I’d be able to help but let me take down a few details.
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Yes, of course.</p>
  <p>Well, firstly, how did you hear about us?</p>
  <p>It was my friend Mav Hamoton ... you did some excellent work for her a&nbsp;couple of years ago. Do you remember?
  </p>
  <p>Oh, yes, that was in West Park Flats, lovely lady.</p>
  <p>Yes, she is.</p>
  <p>And what’s your name, please?</p>
  <p>It's Edith <span class="explainq1 explain">Pargetter.</span></p>
  <p>Edith ... can you spell your surname, please?</p>
  <p>It's P-A-R-G-E-double T-E-R.</p>
  <p>Double T, right. And do you live in West Park Flats as well?</p>
  <p>No, actually it’s <span class="explainq2 explain">East</span> Park, Flat 4.</p>
  <p>Oh, right, that’s over the road, I seem to remember - quite difficult to get to.</p>
  <p>Yes, it’s <span class="explainq3 explain">at the back of the library.</span></p>
  <p>Right, I know. And what’s your phone number?</p>
  <p>875934 but I’m out a great deal in the afternoons and evenings.</p>
  <p><span class="explainq4 explain"> So would the best time to ring you be in the morning?</span></p>
  <p>Yes.</p>
  <p>Fine. I've made a note of that. Can I just ask, I'll be in a van and I know parking’s rather difficult round your
    flats. Where would you recommend?</p>
  <p>Well, I always tell people in larger vehicles to <span class="explainq5 explain">park by the postbox on the other
      side of the road from the entrance.</span></p>
  <p>Good, thanks.</p>
  <p>And will you be able to give me a full itemised quote?</p>
  <p>Oh. yes. <span class="explainq6 explain">I'll&nbsp;list all the jobs separately with individual prices.</span></p>
  <p>That'd be a great help.</p>
  <p>No problem.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Now, what would you like me to do?</p>
  <p>Firstly and most urgently is in the kitchen. With all the weather damage,&nbsp;<span class="explainq7 explain">the
      glass in the door has cracked and I’d need that fixing ...I presume you mean replacing?</span></p>
  <p>Oh, yes. And as soon as possible ...</p>
  <p>What I'll do is come round tomorrow morning and do that immediately.</p>
  <p>Thank you so much. The other things aren’t so urgent but...</p>
  <p>Now, I'll make a note of everything you want doing.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;Well, in the kitchen I’d like some painting doing.</p>
  <p>All the kitchen walls?</p>
  <p><span class="explainq8 explain">Just the area over the cooker. </span>It’s very greasy...&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Right... it does tend to get that way!</p>
  <p>Yes!</p>
  <p>Well, if you want a proper job done what I’d need to do is<span class="explainq9 explain"> strip the old paint and
      plaster it about a week before I paint it.</span></p>
  <p>Of course. Now, May tells me you also do work in the garden.</p>
  <p>that’s right.</p>
  <p>Well, I’d like you to <span class="explainq10 explain">replace a fence.</span></p>
  <p>Just One?</p>
  <p>Yes, at the far end.</p>
  <p>Fine. Shouldn’t be a problem. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>And that’s the lot.</p>
  <p>Fine. Yeah, as I say I can come round tomorrow morning to look over things with you.</p>
  <p>That’s great, thank you.</p>
  <p>So, I’ll look forward to seeing you tomorrow at...</p>
