  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hi Howard ... I haven’t seen you for a while.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hi Joanne. Yeah, they’re keeping us really busy on the postgraduate programme. But
      how are you? You’ll be starting your dissertation soon, won’t you?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah ... tutorials start next week ... I’ve got Dr Peterson. You’ll remember it all
      from last year, of course!</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not something you forget easily. But seriously, although I didn’t expect to
      enjoy writing my dissertation ... and in fact I didn’t really find it much fun, I wouldn’t have missed the
      experience ... <span class="explainq1 explain">I found it really improved my understanding of the whole degree
        programme</span>, you know, from the first year on ...</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what are you doing yours on?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glaciated landscapes ... although I haven’t decided exactly what aspect yet.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I did mine on climate systems, so I can’t help you much I’m afraid. But you’ll be
      fine once you start your tutorials ... Dr Peterson’ll help you focus.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know, and he’ll set me deadlines for the different stages ... which is what I
      need. <span class="explainq2 explain">My concern is that I’ve got tons of material on the topic, and I won’t be
        able to stick to the word limit, you know</span>.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hmm. I remember I had different concerns when I was doing my dissertation.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah ... before my first tutorial I did a lot of fairly general reading ‘cause I
      hadn’t fixed on my topic at that stage. I actually enjoyed that quite a lot and really improved my reading speed,
      you know, so I was getting through a lot of material. <span class="explainq3 explain">I was frightened I wouldn’t
        remember it all</span> though so I got into the habit of making very detailed notes.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So did you find your tutor helpful .in getting you started?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah we certainly had some interesting discussions but it’s funny ...<span
        class="explainq4 explain"> I saw a brilliant programme about climate change and it was that that really fired me
        up</span>. It was talking about some recent research which seemed to contradict some of the articles I’d been
      reading. Hmmm.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So you say your tutorials start next week?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, the first month’s crucial. You’ve got to meet your tutor and decide on your
      focus but don’t become too dependent on him...you know, don’t see him every week...only when you want to check
      something.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve got the focus you’ve got to get reading - <span
        class="explainq5 explain">it’s helpful to look through the bibliographies for all the course modules relating to
        your topic</span>. And get hold of any books you think you’ll need.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I haven’t got much money ...</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mean get the books from the library, far better.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I suppose I should prepare a detailed outline of the chapters?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah absolutely . but don’t feel you have to follow it slavishly . it’s meant to be
      flexible.</span></p>
  <ol>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Now, I’m someone who likes to get writing quickly ... I can’t just sit and read
        for a month.</span></li>
  </ol>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not like me then ... but if that’s what suits you, you know, your natural approach,
      then <span class="explainq6 explain">you really ought to start immediately and write the first chapter</span>
      ...</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now Joanne, about the library ... it’s worthwhile getting on good terms with the
      staff ... they aren’t always helpful with undergraduates .</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I suppose they focus on post-grads more.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe . but show them you’re serious about wanting to do good work.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And what if I can’t find what I need?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, there’s inter-library loans ...</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Borrowing books from other libraries ... but I’ve heard it isn’t all that
      reliable.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re right.. .but you probably won’t need it anyway ... be positive, the library
      is likely to have most things you need ... and <span class="explainq7 explain">during the dissertation writing
        period, you can take out fifteen instead of the usual ten books.</span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should I look at previous years’ dissertations?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can do .</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I won’t know which are the good ones.</span></p>
  <p><span class="explainq8 explain">The library only keeps the best and the staff can advise you.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are they willing to do that?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh yeah .</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I’m worried about getting journal articles ... from the electronic
      library.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, have you tried to find any yet?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well you should . it’s really straightforward.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s obviously something I’ll have to look into.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr Peterson will help.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, I know I can go to him if I have any worries.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Except he will be away in the second month - it’s the holidays. <span
        class="explainq9 explain">You should ask him what to do while he’s away.</span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gosh, yeah ... but I suppose I can get a lot of support from coursemates ... I know
      a couple of people who are thinking of doing the same topic as me.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take care, collaboration can become dependency. I think you’d better see how that
      works out what the people are like.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re probably right ... About other reading, I suppose Dr Peterson’ll recommend
      plenty of good articles to get me started.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing I’d find out is what his attitude is to <span
        class="explainq10 explain">internet sources</span>.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surely not in this day and age? I’d better get that sorted out right at the
      beginning.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would if I were you.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I’ve also got some questions about the research sections - how much time I
      should spend explaining the process.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I think that’s up to you ... you can see how it develops as you’re
      writing.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OK.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s the same with things like time management . that’s something a tutor can’t
      really help you with .</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I agree!</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So is there anything else you need me to go over .</span></p>
