    <h2>Ocean Biodiversity</h2>

  <p>I’ve been looking at ocean biodiversity, that’s the diversity of species that live in the world’s oceans. About 20
    years ago biologists developed the idea of what they called ‘biodiversity&nbsp;hotspots’. These are the areas which
    have the greatest mixture of species, so one example&nbsp;is Madagascar. These hotspots are significant because they
    allow us to locate key areas for&nbsp;focusing efforts at<span class="explainq1 explain"> conservation.</span>
    Biologists can identify hotspots on land, fairly easily, but until&nbsp;recently, very little was known about
    species distribution and diversity in the oceans, and no&nbsp;one even knew if hotspots existed there.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Then a Canadian biologist called Boris Worm did some research in 2005 on data on ocean species that he got from the
    fishing industry. Worm located five hotspots for large ocean&nbsp;predators like sharks, and looked at what they had
    in common. The main thing he’d expected&nbsp;to find was that they had very high concentrations of <span
      class="explainq2 explain">food</span>, but to his surprise that was only&nbsp;true for four of the hotspots - the
    remaining hotspot was quite badly off in that regard.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>But what he did find was that in all cases, the water at the <span class="explainq3 explain">surface</span> of the
    ocean had relatively high temperatures, even when it was cool at greater depths, so this seemed to be a factor
    in&nbsp;supporting a diverse range of these large predators. However, this wasn’t enough on its own,</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>because he also found that the water needed to have enough <span class="explainq4 explain">oxygen</span> in it - so
    these two factors seemed necessary to support the high metabolic rate of these large fish.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A couple of years later, in 2007, a researcher called Lisa Ballance, who was working in California, also started
    looking for ocean hotspots, but not for fish - what she was interested&nbsp;in was marine <span
      class="explainq5 explain">mammals</span>, things like seals. And she found three places in the oceans
    which&nbsp;were hotspots, and what these had in common was that these hotspots were all located at&nbsp;boundaries
    between ocean currents, and this seems to be the sort of place that has lots of&nbsp;the plankton that some of these
    species feed on.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So now people who want to protect the species that are endangered need to get as much information as possible. For
    example, there’s an international project called the Census of&nbsp;Marine Life. They’ve been surveying oceans all
    over the world, including the Arctic. One&nbsp;thing they found there which stunned other researchers was that there
    were large numbers&nbsp;of species which live below the <span class="explainq6 explain">ice</span> - sometimes under
    a layer up to 20 metres thick. Some&nbsp;of these species had never been seen before. They’ve even found species of
    octopus living&nbsp;in these conditions. And other scientists working on the same project, but researching
    very&nbsp;different habitats on the ocean floor, have found large numbers of species congregating&nbsp;around
    volcanoes, attracted to them by the warmth and nutrients there.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>However, biologists still don’t know how serious the threat to their survival is for each individual species. So a
    body called the Global Marine Species Assessment is now creating&nbsp;a list of endangered species on land, so they
    consider things like the size of the population&nbsp;- how many members of one species there are in a particular
    place - and then they look at&nbsp;their distribution in geographical terms, although this is quite difficult when
    you’re looking at&nbsp;fish, because they’re so mobile, and then thirdly they calculate the rate at which the <span
      class="explainq7 explain">decline</span> of&nbsp;the species is happening.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So far only 1,500 species have been assessed, but they want to increase this figure to 20,000. For each one they
    assess, they use the data they collect on that species to produce&nbsp;a <span class="explainq8 explain">map</span>
    showing its distribution. Ultimately they will be able to use these to figure out not only&nbsp;where most species
    are located but also where they are most threatened.</p>
  <p>So finally, what can be done to retain the diversity of species in the world’s oceans? Firstly, we need to set up
    more reserves in our oceans, places where marine species are protected.&nbsp;We have some, but not enough. In
    addition, to preserve species such as leatherback turtles,</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>which live out in the high seas but have their nesting sites on the American coast, we need to create corridors for
    <span class="explainq9 explain">migration,</span>&nbsp;so they can get from one area to another safely. As well as
    this action needs to be taken to lower the levels of fishing quotas to prevent overfishing of&nbsp;endangered
    species. And finally, there's the problem of 'by-catch'. This refers to the catching&nbsp;of unwanted fish by
    fishing boats - they're returned to the sea, but they're often dead or&nbsp;dying.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;If these commercial fishing boats used equipment which was more selective, so that,&nbsp;only the
            fish wanted for <span class="explainq10 explain">consumption</span> were caught, this problem could be
            overcome.</p>
          <p>OK. So does anyone have any ...</p>
