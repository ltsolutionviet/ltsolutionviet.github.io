    <p>Oh, excuse me! Have you ever yawned because somebody else yawned? You aren’t especially tired, yet suddenly your
        mouth opens wide and a big yawn comes out.</p>
    <p>This phenomenal is known as contagious yawning and while scientists still don’t fully understand why it happens,
        there are many hypothesis currently being researched. Let’s take a look at a few of the most prevalent ones,
        beginning with two <span class="explainq2 explain">physiological</span> <span
            class="explainq1 explain">hypotheses</span> before moving to a psychological one.</p>
    <p>Our first physiological hypothesis states that contagious yawning is triggered by a<span
            class="explainq3 explain"> specific stimulus</span>, an initial yawn. This is called <span
            class="explainq4 explain">fixed action</span> pattern. Think of fixed action pattern like a <span
            class="explainq5 explain">reflex</span>, your yawn makes me yawn, similar to a domino effect, one person’s
        yawn triggers a yawn in a person nearby that has observed the act. Once this reflex is triggered it must run its
        course. Have you ever tried to stop the yawn once it has begun? Basically impossible!</p>
    <p>Another physiological hypothesis is known as non-conscious mimicry or the <span
            class="explainq6 explain">chameleon</span> effect. This occurs when you imitate someone’s behavior without
        knowing it, a subtle and unintentional copycat maneuver. People tend to mimic each other’s postures: if you are
        seated across from someone that has their legs crossed, you might cross your own legs. This hypothesis suggests
        that we yawn when we see someone else yawn because we are unconsciously copying his or her behavior. Scientists
        believe that this chameleon effect is possible because of a special set of neurons known as <span
            class="explainq7 explain">mirror neurons</span>. Mirror neurons are a type of brain cell that responds
        equally when we perform an action as when we see someone else perform the same action. These neurons are
        important for learning and self-awareness.</p>
    <p>For example, watching someone do something physical like knitting or putting on lipstick can help you do those
        same action more accurately. Neuro imaging studies using FmRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging, shows that
        when we see someone yawn or even hear their yawn a specific area of the brain housing these mirror neurons tends
        to light up which in turn causes us to respond with the same action. A yawn!</p>
    <p>Our psychological hypothesis also involves the work of these mirror neurons? We will call it the <span
            class="explainq8 explain">empathy yawn</span>. Empathy is the ability to understand what someone else is
        feeling and partake in their emotion, a crucial ability for social animals like us. Recently neuroscientists
        have found that a subset of mirror neurons allows us to empathize with others’ feelings at a deeper level.
        Scientists discovered that this emphatic response to yawning while testing the first hypothesis we mentioned,
        fixed action pattern. The study was set up to show that <span class="explainq9 explain">dogs</span> will enact a
        yawn reflex at the mere sound of a human yawn.</p>
    <p>While the study showed this was true, they found something else interesting. Dogs yawn more frequently at
        familiar yawns such as from their owners than at unfamiliar yawns from strangers. Following this research, other
        studies on humans and primates have also shown that contagious yawning occurs more frequently among <span
            class="explainq10 explain">friends</span> than strangers. In fact, contagious yawning starts occurring when
        we are about four or five years old, at the point when children develop their ability to identify others’
        emotions properly. Still, while neuroscientific studies aim to prove that contagious yawning is based on this
        capacity for empathy, more research is needed to shed light on what exactly is going on.</p>
    <p>It’s possible that the answer lies in another hypothesis all together. The next time you get caught in a yawn,
        take a second to think about what’s just happened: Were you thinking about a yawn? Did someone near you yawn?
        Was that personal a stranger or someone close? And are you yawning right know?</p>
