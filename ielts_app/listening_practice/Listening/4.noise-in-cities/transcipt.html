          <p>This lecture will be about the science of acoustics, the study of sound, in relation to urban environments
            such as cities. As an acoustic engineer myself, I think this is an area where we’re likely to see great
            changes. In the past, researching urban soundscapes was simple. We measured levels of sound in decibels, so
            I used to take my sound meter and l measured the noise somewhere, and then I might ask a sample of people to
            say at what level the sound<br>became annoying.</p>
          <p>With data like this, acoustic engineers have been able to build up what we call noise maps, maps of the
            sound environment. But actually these aren’t a lot of use. What they do show is that the highest noise
            levels are generally on roads - well, that’s not really very surprising.</p>
          <p>But there’s quite a lot going on that these maps don<sup>,</sup>t show, because they can’t capture the
            complex way that sound varies overtime. So <span class="explainq1 explain">they ignore important issues such
              as the noise someone might hear from the open windows or gardens of their neighbours</span>,- and this
            sort of noise can be quite significant in summer. We don’t have any databases on this sort of information.
            As well as that, these records of sound levels take no account of the fact that people vary in their
            perceptions of noise - so someone like me with years of working in acoustics might be very different from
            you in that regard.</p>
          <p>But anyway. even though these noise maps are fairly crude, <span class="explainq2 explain">they’ve been
              useful in providing information and raising awareness that noise matters, we need to deal with it and so
              it’s a political matter</span>. And that’s important - we need rules and regulations because noise can
            cause all sorts of problems.</p>
          <p>Those of you who are city-dwellers know that things go on 24 hours a day, so city-dwellers often suffer
            from interrupted sleep. It’s also known that noise can lead to a rise in levels of stress, due to physical
            changes in the body affecting the composition of the blood. And there are other problems as well, for
            instance <span class="explainq3 explain">if schoolchildren don’t have a quiet place to study. their work
              will suffer.</span></p>
          <p>Now, one problem with decibel measurement is that it doesn’t differentiate between different types of
            noise. <span class="explainq4 explain">Some types of sounds that most people would probably think of as nice
              and relaxing might well score quite highly in decibel levels - think of the sound made by a fountain in a
              town square, for example</span>. That’s not necessarily something that we’d want to control or reduce. So
            maybe researchers should consider these sorts of sounds in urban design. This is going to be tricky because
            just measuring decibel levels isn’t going to help us here. <span class="explainq5 explain">Instead, many
              researchers are using social science techniques. studying people’s emotional response to sound by using
              questionnaires and so on.</span></p>
          <p>So what exactly do people want to hear in an urban environment? Some recent interdisciplinary research has
            come out with results that at first sight seem contradictory - <span class="explainq6 explain">a city needs
              to have a sense of activity, so it needs to be lively, with sounds like the clack of high heels on a
              pavement or the hiss of a coffee machine, but these mustn’t be too intrusive, because at the same time we
              need to be able to relax.</span></p>
          <p><span class="explainq7 explain">One of the major problems in achieving this will be getting architects and
              town planners to &nbsp;use the research. Apart from studying the basics of acoustics, these people receive
              very little training in this area</span>. But in fact they should be regarding sound as an opportunity to
            add to the experience of urban living, whereas at present they tend to see it as something to be avoided or
            reduced as far as possible, or something that’s just a job for engineers like the street drainage system.
          </p>
          <p>What’s needed is for noise in cities to be regarded as an aesthetic quality, as something that has the
            qualities of an art form. If we acknowledge this, then we urgently need to know what governs it and how
            designers can work with it. <span class="explainq8 explain">We need to develop a complex &nbsp;understanding
              of many factors. What is the relationship between sound and culture?</span> What can we learn from
            disciplines such as psychology about the way that sound interacts with human development and social
            relationships, and the way that sound affects our thought and feelings? <span class="explainq9 explain">Can
              we learn anything from physics about the nature of sound itself?</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
          <p>Today’s powerful technologies can also help us. To show us their ideas and help us to imagine the effect
            their buildings will have, <span class="explainq10 explain">architects and town planners already use virtual
              &nbsp;reality - but these programs are silent</span>. In the future such programs could use realistic
            sounds, meaning that soundscapes could be explored before being built. So hopefully, using the best
            technology we can lay our hands on, the city of the future will be a pleasure to the ears as well as the
            eyes.</p>
