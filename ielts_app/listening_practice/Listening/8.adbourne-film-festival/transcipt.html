    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today we’re pleased to have on the show Fatima Johnson who is the organiser of
            the Adbourne Film Festival. Welcome, Fatima.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hello.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can you tell us a bit about the background to the festival and what it brings to
            the town? Well the festival was started in nineteen ninety six by the then Mayor of
            Adbourne,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanne Smith. She wasn’t a film maker herself - she’d
            actually been a very energetic tourism development officer for many years - but Adbourne had run a classical
            music festival which had been becoming less and less popular in recent years ... Joanne was looking around
            for something to replace it and to <span class="explainq1 explain">use funds allocated to it to promote
                something which local people can enjoy</span>.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great. So tell us about the festival nowadays ...</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, it’s held in the last two weeks of August every year and short films from
            all over the world are shown in three places - in the theatre and our two cinemas. Several films are shown
            in one performance and the whole thing lasts about ninety minutes. <span class="explainq2 explain">Tickets
                are very reasonably priced - under twelves used to get in for fifty pee but now we charge just one pound
                which is still very good value! One pound fifty for students and two pounds fifty for everyone
                else</span>. Performances are advertised all round town and also on our website</span><a
            href="http://www.adbournefest.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">www.adbournefest.com</span></a><span
            style="font-weight: 400;">. If you’re interested in attending any performances <span
                class="explainq3 explain">you can buy tickets online of course and you can also get them in the
                library</span>, which is right next to the main shopping area - I’m afraid this year, tickets are no
            longer available from either of the two cinemas because of restricted opening times.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I understand you also run a film competition?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, for under eighteens. We have a different theme every year. Last year for
            example, the theme was ‘Future Planet’ and the winner was a ten minute documentary encouraging youngsters to
            be more aware of environmental issues, <span class="explainq4 explain">focusing on getting school kids to
                cycle to school instead of going by car</span>. This year the theme is ‘Sporting Nation’ - so there’ll
            also be lots of ideas to choose from. Now we’re always on the look-out for new local talent so if you live
            in the Adbourne area and are under eighteen, you should have a go. We have an excellent prize every year,
            donated by local businesses - shops, hotels etc. This year you can win a <span
                class="explainq5 explain">hi-spec movie camera</span> worth over eight hundred pounds. Application forms
            are on the website and the deadline for sending in your film to enter the competition is the last day of
            <span class="explainq6 explain">July</span>. It’s May now so you’ll have the whole of June to be working on
            it!</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And what are the judges looking for?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, although we choose very topical issues like the environment, we’re not
            looking for <strong>propaganda</strong> - you know, trying to get people to do something. <span
                class="explainq8 explain">Instead we’re looking for a new angle ... a fresh way of looking at a
                theme</span>. And of course, because it’s a short-film festival, it’s not really about a fully worked
            story with well-rounded characters, it’s more about <span class="explainq7 explain">good photography</span>
            ... conveying things visually.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And who judges the films?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A panel of three people who know a lot about film. We’ve used the same judges for
            many years and we’re very happy with their expertise. One thing we probably will change
            next&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">year though is <span class="explainq9 explain">we want to
                add another class and another prize for older film makers</span>. We’ll keep it at a maximum of ten
            minutes though ... the length works well for our festival. We also want to use <span
                class="explainq10 explain">different venues for the film shows ... such as community centres and at
                least one school</span>. It might make performances more accessible to a wider audience. We did explore
            the possibility of having late-night showings but that’s unlikely to happen in the coming year.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, as I say, if anyone’s interested in submitting a film for our competition, go
            onto our website and you’ll be able ...</span></p>
