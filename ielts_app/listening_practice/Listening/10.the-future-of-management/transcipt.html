    <p>Well, I’ve been talking to managers in a number of businesses, and reading surveys about the future of
        management. And what I'm going to present in this seminar is a few ideas about how the activity is likely to
        change in the next ten years. It isn't a scientific, statistical analysis - just some ideas for us to discuss.
    </p>
    <p>One area I want to mention is business markets, and I’m sure a really significant development will be<span
            class="explainq1 explain"> a major increase in competition,</span> with companies from all round&nbsp;the
        world trying to sell similar products.</p>
    <p>Consumers will have much more choice - for instance, food products sold in Australia might be manufactured in the
        USA, China, Finland and dozens of other countries. At the same time, mergers and takeovers mean that <span
            class="explainq2 explain">governments are actually losing power to major global corporations.</span></p>
    <p>We can probably all think of companies that exert a great deal of influence, which may be good for
        consumers.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A third point I want to make about markets is that <span class="explainq3 explain">in the rapidly expanding
            economies, such as India. China. Brazil and Russia, demand is growing very fast.</span></p>
    <p>This is putting pressure on resources all over the world.&nbsp;I think businesses are becoming more open to
        external influences. In particular, <span class="explainq4 explain">companies are consulting customers more and
            more before making their business decisions.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>Companies are finding out what they want and providing it, instead of making products and then trying to sell
        them, which is the model of years ago.</p>
    <p><span class="explainq5 explain">Another influence is that concerns about the environment will force manufacturers
            to extend product, lifecycles, to reduce the amount of pollution and waste. And in some cases, regulation
            will need to be strengthened.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>Many societies are much more fluid and democratic, and the structure of companies is changing to reflect that.
        <span class="explainq6 explain">I think we're going to see a greater emphasis within companies on teams created
            with a specific project in mind.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>And when they're completed, the teams will be disbanded and new ones formed.</p>
    <p>More and more people see work as simply one part of their lifestyle, and not the most important one, and as the
        workforce is shrinking in some countries, businesses are having to compete for staff instead of being able to
        choose among a lot of applicants. <span class="explainq7 explain">Typical examples that will attract and retain
            staff are traditional ones like flexible hours</span> and - something that has been made possible by
        advances in technology - remote working, with people based at their home, abroad, or almost anywhere they
        choose.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Management styles will almost certainly continue to change. Senior managers will require a lot more than the
        efficiency that they’ve always needed.<span class="explainq8 explain"> Above all they'll need great skills in
            leadership,</span> so that their organisation can initiate and respond to change in a fast-moving world,
        where they face lots of competing requirements and potential conflicts.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In most of the world, the senior managers of large businesses are mainly men in their fifties and sixties.<span
            class="explainq9 explain"> The predominant style of management will almost certainly become more
            consultative and collaborative, caused above all, by more women moving into senior management
            positions.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>Many of the changes are influenced by developments in the wider economy. The traditional emphasis of business was
        manufacturing, and of course the service sector is very important. But we shouldn’t overlook the growing
        financial contribution of IP, that is, intellectual property. Some books and films generate enormous sums from
        the sale of related DVDs, music, games, clothes, and so on.</p>
    <p>Another point I’d like to make is that although I’ve been talking about companies, one trend that they have to
        face is the move away from people working for the same employer for years.<span class="explainq10 explain">
            Instead, more and more people are becoming self-employed</span>, to gain the freedom and control over their
        lives that they’re unlikely to get from being employed.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>OK, well that's all I want to say, so let’s open it up for discussion.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
