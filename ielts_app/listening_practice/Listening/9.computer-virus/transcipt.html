  <p>Lecturer Good morning, everybody. Now last week we were looking at the positive effects that computers have had on
    our society. This week I’d like to talk about one of the negatives - computer viruses.</p>
  <p>So what is a computer virus? Well, it is a software program that has been created by a human programmer with the
    single intention of corrupting and destroying useful programs. Put in simple terms, it’s a way of causing lots of
    trouble for ordinary people!&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It’s known as a virus because, although it’s not <span class="explainq1 explain">a biological organism</span>, it
    functions in a similar way in that it looks for a host, that is, a body - your computer - in which to live and
    multiply, with the one aim of destroying that host.</p>
  <p>Let’s go back 50 years. In 1949 the first model of a computer virus program was presented in a paper by John von
    Neumann. Soon after this was published, a game known as Core Wars appeared on the scene. Core Wars was initially
    created for intellectual <span class="explainq2 explain">entertainment</span> by three Americans working on large
    mainframe computers. By the 1980s, for the very small sum of $2.00 postage, anyone could get details on how to play
    Core Wars and create programs that could escape from the game and destroy other programs.</p>
  <p>Computer viruses are picked up in much the same way as their biological counterparts - that is, through contact
    with others, and this can happen very easily, as literally millions of people are in touch with each other by email
    every day. Virus programs are often intentionally placed within useful programs such as commercial websites or they
    are included in <span class="explainq3 explain">software that you might have got from friends or downloaded from
      somewhere without knowing its real source</span>.</p>
  <p>It seems quite hard to believe that anyone would go to all this trouble to intentionally spoil the data of other
    people, but the rise in the number of computer software infections, and the amount of lost data that we are seeing
    these days, is proof that these attackers are going to extremes to do just that ... going out of their way to <span
      class="explainq4 explain">create programs that hide inside legitimate software</span> and cause all sorts of
    errors that their victims will then mistake for hardware failure - believing that the problem lies with their own
    computer.</p>
  <p>There are many types of virus, such as worms and Trojan horses, and each has its own purpose. One function of a
    Trojan, for instance, is to destroy and delete files on your computer. They attack by generating a lot of email and
    Internet traffic on your machine until it becomes completely overloaded and you can no longer use your computer. It
    then does the same to your friends’ machines.</p>
  <p>Bad enough, you may think. But a Trojan also allows the attacker to <span class="explainq5 explain">use the
      victim’s computer to purchase goods with stolen credit cards or access illegal websites</span>.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So, what can we do to combat these people? Well, the first thing is to realise that virus programmers succeed
    because people are not always careful about where they get their programs from. So, number one - <span
      class="explainq6 explain">be very careful</span>. And 1 don’t just mean that you should be careful about the
    source of your software, you also need to take care with emails and avoid any messages which are suspicious-looking.
    So the second golden rule is ‘<span class="explainq7 explain">avoid trouble</span>’. For instance, do not open any
    message that says ‘I love you’ or ‘Win $50’. A third thing we can do involves trying to find out exactly how the
    viruses work - in other words, we need to <span class="explainq8 explain">understand the viruses</span>. And, of
    course, there is a good selection of anti-virus software available on the market now to combat the virus plague, so
    another way of protecting ourselves and our computers is to <span class="explainq9 explain">be well prepared</span>.
  </p>
  <p>If you follow these basic rules, <span class="explainq10 explain">you really shouldn’t have any problems</span>.
