  <p>MARTIN:</p>
  <p>Good morning. This is Burnham tourist office, Martin speaking.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>SUE:</p>
  <p>Oh, hello. I saw a poster about free things to do in the area, and it said people should phone you for information.
    I'm coming to Burnham with my husband and two children&nbsp;for a few days on June the 27th, or possibly the 28th,
    and <span class="explainqe explain">I'd like some ideas for things to do on the 29th</span>.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>MARTIN:</p>
  <p>Yes, of course. OK. Then let's start with a couple of events especially for children. The art gallery is holding an
    event called ‘Family Welcome' that day, when there are&nbsp;activities and trails to use throughout the gallery.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>SUE:</p>
  <p>That sounds interesting. What time does it start?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>MARTIN:</p>
  <p>The gallery opens at 10, and the ‘Family Welcome’ event runs from <span class="explainq1 explain">10.30</span>
    until 2 o’clock. The gallery stays open until 5. And several times during the day, they’re&nbsp;going to show a
    short film that the gallery has produced. It demonstrates how&nbsp;<span class="explainq2 explain">ceramics</span>
    are made, and there'll be equipment and materials for children to have a go&nbsp;themselves. Last time they ran the
    event, there was a film about painting, which went&nbsp;down very well with the children, and they’re now working on
    one about sculpture</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>SUE:</p>
  <p>I like the sound of that. And what other events happen in Burnham?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>MARTIN:</p>
  <p>Well, do you all enjoy listening to music?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>SUE:</p>
  <p>Oh, yes.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>MARTIN:</p>
  <p>Well there are several free concerts taking place at different times - one or two in the morning, the majority at
    <span class="explainq3 explain">lunchtime</span>, and a couple in the evening. And they range from&nbsp;pop music to
    Latin American.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>SUE:</p>
  <p>MARTIN:</p>
  <p>The Latin American could be fun. What time is that?</p>
  <p>It’s being repeated several times, in different places. They’re performing in the central library at 1 o’clock,
    then at 4 it’s in the City <span class="explainq4 explain">Museum</span>, and in the evening at 7.30&nbsp;there’s a
    longer concert, in the theatre.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>SUE:</p>
  <p>Right. I’ll suggest that to the rest of the family.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>MARTIN:</p>
  <p>Something else you might be interested in is the boat race along the river.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>SUE:</p>
  <p>Oh, yes, do tell me about that.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>MARTIN:</p>
  <p>The race starts at <span class="explainq5 explain">Offord Marina</span>, to the north of Burnham, and goes as far
    as</p>
  <p>Summer Pool. The best place to watch it from is Charlesworth Bridge, though that does get rather crowded.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>SUE:</p>
  <p>And who’s taking part?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>MARTIN:</p>
  <p>Well&nbsp;local boat clubs, but the standard is very high.<span class="explainq6 explain"> One of them came first
      in the West of England regional championship in May this year</span> - it was the first time a team
    from&nbsp;Burnham has won. It means that next year they'll be representing the region in the national championship.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>SUE:</p>
  <p>Now I’ve heard something about Paxton Nature Reserve. It’s a good place for spotting unusual <span
      class="explainq7 explain">birds</span>, isn’t it?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>MARTIN:</p>
  <p>That’s right - throughout the year. There is a lake there, as well as a river, and they provide a very attractive
    habitat. So it’s a good idea to bring binoculars if you have them. And just at&nbsp;the moment you can see various
    <span class="explainq8 explain">flowers</span> that are pretty unusual - the soil at Paxton isn’t very&nbsp;common.
    They’re looking good right now.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>SUE:</p>
  <p>Right. My husband will be particularly interested in that.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>MARTIN:</p>
  <p>And there’s going to be a talk and slide show about <span class="explainq9 explain">mushrooms</span> - and you’ll
    be able to go out. and pick some afterwards and study the different varieties.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>SUE:</p>
  <p>Uhuh. And is it possible for children to swim in the <span class="explainq10 explain">river</span>?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>MARTIN:</p>
  <p>Yes. <span class="explainq10 explain">Part of it has been fenced off to make it safe for children to swim
      in</span>. It’s very shallow, and there’s a lifeguard on duty whenever it’s open. The lake is too deep, so
    swimming isn’t allowed there.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>SUE:</p>
  <p>OK, we must remember to bring their swimming things, in case we go to Paxton. How long does it take to get there by
    car from Burnham?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>MARTIN:</p>
  <p>About 20 minutes, but parking is very limited, so it’s usually much easier to go by bus - and it takes about the
    same time.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>SUE:</p>
  <p>Right. Well, I’ll discuss the options with the rest of the family. Thanks very much for all your help.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>MARTIN:</p>
  <p>You’re welcome.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>SUE:</p>
  <p>Goodbye.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>MARTIN:</p>
  <p>Bye.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
