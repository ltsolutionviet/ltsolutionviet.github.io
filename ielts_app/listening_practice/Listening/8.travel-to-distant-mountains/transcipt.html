  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clive &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span
      style="font-weight: 400;">Hello?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Debbie &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Hi, Clive, is that
      you'?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, hi, Debbie.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">D </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you manage to see those candidates for
      our expedition'?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, I did, and there was an extra one who
      was quite a surprise. You know, he hadn’t applied and he just turned up out of the blue, so we haven't got any
      details for him.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">D </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Really</span><span
      style="font-weight: 400;">1</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? Tell me about him</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">OK, and you can take some notes Then we'll
      see what we think</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">D </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fine.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, he’s called Sanjay <span
        class="explainq1 explain">Dubashi</span>.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">D </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">OK Sanjay is spelled S-A-N-J-A-Y,
      right?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Correct And Dubashi is
      D-U-B-A-S-H-l</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">D </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">D-U-B-A-S-H-l, fine, thanks, I'm just
      getting that down And did you find out how old he is?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure, he's round about our age, you know -
      well, a couple of years older, he’s <span class="explainq2 explain">27</span>, quite a big man, quite muscular,
      impressive, with a big moustache</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">D </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And what does he do'?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, actually, he just says he's an <span
        class="explainq3 explain">office worker</span>, you know, just one of those people with quite a routine job in
      an office.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">D </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mm, doesn’t sound like he finds his job
      very interesting Has he got any experience, do you know, of going off to remote places on foot?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C Yes, he’s been all over the place He was telling me all about a trip he made in a
      Land Rover across <span class="explainq4 explain">Central Africa</span> from one side to the other, which sounded
      pretty exciting And dangerous</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">D </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great! I think it would be really
      interesting to cross Central Africa. I’d love to do that. Anything physical</span><span
      style="font-weight: 400;">1</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? I mean, where he actually had to walk instead
      of driving - you know, being so muscular, as you say?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mm, I was coming to that Last year, he
      went to Russia with some friends in their summer holidays and they went up a mountain. Let’s see, urn, Mount <span
        class="explainq5 explain">Elbrus</span>, it’s called.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">D </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wow, now that’s really quite something. By
      the way, Elbrus is spelled E-L-B-R-O-S, isn’t it?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not quite, it’s U-S</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">D </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah, OK What qualifications does he have
      which would interest us</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">1</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? Has he
      done any sort of specialist training, for example</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">1</span><span
      style="font-weight: 400;">?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, he’s done a course in <span
        class="explainq5 explain explainq6">first aid</span>, which may be pretty useful. If any of us get injured, he
      should know what to do.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">D </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good. It might be useful to have someone
      who knows how to do first aid in case someone has an accident. Can he swim?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn't ask, now you mention it. I forgot
      But he did tell me he can hold conversations in <span class="explainq7 explain">five languages.</span> He’s not
      fluent in all of them, but he can get by. He grew up in India, and I suppose that helps, you know, for learning
      languages, though now he lives over here.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">D </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right. What else? Has he been to
      university, for instance?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, he graduated in <span
        class="explainq8 explain">media studies</span>, though he says he's never worked in the media</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">D: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">OK, and when he’s not off on expeditions
      to remote places, what does he like doing in his spare time</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">1</span><span
      style="font-weight: 400;">?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He seems to do all sorts of things One
      thing he told me which could be useful is that he likes <span class="explainq9 explain">fishing</span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">D </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, we’d better tell him to bring his
      fishing rod - that is, if we choose him.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And he seems to spend a lot of time at the
      gym - he says he really likes to keep <span class="explainq10 explain">fit</span> And when you meet him, you’ll
      believe it’s true</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">D </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great, another fitness fanatic, like you.
      Well, sounds like I should meet him, doesn't it? When can you fix that up?</span></p>
