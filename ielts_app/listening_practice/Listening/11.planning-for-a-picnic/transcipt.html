    <p>Cindy: So, Bob, how many people have said that they’re coming on the&nbsp;company picnic&nbsp;?<br>Bob: Well,
        Cindy, we’ve got 35&nbsp;definite&nbsp;and another 10 probable.<br>Cindy: Shall we say <span
            class="explainq1 explain">50</span>?<br>Bob: I&nbsp;think so. And we’ve&nbsp;fixed&nbsp;the date
        for…?<br>Cindy: <span class="explainq2 explain">26th</span>. The last Sunday in August.<br>Bob: Great! I hope
        the weather is good.<br>Cindy: Should be. Now, we have to decide where to order the food from and what kind of
        things we want.<br>Bob: Right. What’s our budget?<br>Cindy: We decided to go for <span
            class="explainq3 explain">£10 a head for food and £5 a head for drinks.</span><br>Bob: OK. I got
        some&nbsp;pamphlets&nbsp;from caterers. What do you think?<br>Cindy: The most important thing is to make sure
        there’s a&nbsp;variety&nbsp;of food. We don’t want people&nbsp;complaining&nbsp;that they don’t like
        anything.<br>Bob: We also don’t want food that could&nbsp;deteriorate in the sun-<span
            class="explainq4 explain">ice cream</span>, that kind of thing.<br>Cindy: You’ve seen these pamphlets. What
        do you think?<br>Bob: Well, I thought Paris Kitchen looked good. The price almost exactly meets
        our&nbsp;budget&nbsp;and they seem to have a good variety.<br>Cindy: I don’t know. A friend of mine used them
        for her company and wasn’t&nbsp;impressed.<br>Bob: Really? What exactly didn’t she like?<br>Cindy: Well, the
        food… she said the food was good, but not quite the variety they’d&nbsp;expected. The drinks included some <span
            class="explainq5 explain">wine</span>, which was&nbsp;apparently&nbsp;not very good.<br>Bob: Oh. Well,
        perhaps we need to consider this one… er … Company Caterers.<br>Cindy: Looks a bit&nbsp;pricey. Mind you, I’ve
        heard that they are very good.<br>Bob: Let me check the price. … Yes … £12 a head for food. That’s more than our
        budget. Do you think we could get a&nbsp;discount?<br>Cindy: Let’s see if it says anything in the pamphlet. …
        Yes, they do offer a discount for groups of more than 30. … <span class="explainq6 explain">10%</span> … does
        that help us?<br>Bob: 10% off £12 … It’s still more than we&nbsp;budgeted&nbsp;for.<br>Cindy: Hey, look at this
        one. Celebrations.<br>Bob: It’s a new company. I asked a few people about them, but no-one has any
        ideas.<br>Cindy: Well, let’s see.&nbsp;9 poundsa head for food and&nbsp;five pounds&nbsp;a head for drinks.
        That’s fine. What kind of food do they have? It says here that they just provide&nbsp;<span
            class="explainq7 explain">cold meals</span>&nbsp;for picnics. Well, that’s OK. … And they
        include&nbsp;vegetarian&nbsp;dishes…. We do have some <span class="explainq8 explain">vegetarian</span> to take
        into&nbsp;consideration&nbsp;.<br>Bob: Well, it looks good to me. The only problem is their lack of experience.
        I mean, it’s a bit of a risk, isn’t it?<br>Cindy: Yes. If the food is no good, we’ll
        look&nbsp;incompetent.<br>Bob: Ah, look here. It says that we can visit their&nbsp;premises&nbsp;and try some of
        the dishes they offer.<br>Cindy: You mean we might get a free lunch? Shall we call them and arrange to go and
        see them?<br>Bob: OK. Which day? How about tomorrow?<br>Cindy: No. We’ve got that meeting. The day after
        tomorrow.&nbsp;<span class="explainq9 explain">Thursday</span>.<br>Bob: Good. Time?<br>Cindy: 11?<br>Bob: Good.
        Right, what’s their phone number?&nbsp;<span class="explainq10 explain">28 65 34 79</span>. We also need to ask
        them whether they can deliver straight to the picnic site, don’t we?<br>Cindy: Yes. I don’t think that’ll be a
        problem, though. I mean, it’s on the&nbsp;outskirts&nbsp;of the city, but it’s not too far away. Does the price
        include&nbsp;delivery?<br>Bob: It doesn’t say, but the other companies include it, so they should. If they
        don’t., our budget still allows us to pay a small fee.</p>
