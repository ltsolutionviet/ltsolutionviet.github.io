    <p>I would like to share with you this morning some&nbsp;<span class="explainq1 explain">stories</span>&nbsp;about
        the ocean&nbsp;through my work as a still photographer&nbsp;for National Geographic magazine.&nbsp;I guess I
        became an underwater photographer&nbsp;and a <span class="explainq2 explain">photojournalist</span> because I
        fell in love with the sea as a child.&nbsp;And I wanted to tell stories&nbsp;about all the amazing things I was
        seeing <span class="explainq3 explain">underwater</span>,&nbsp;incredible wildlife and interesting
        behaviors.&nbsp;And after even 30 years of doing this,&nbsp;after 30 years of exploring the ocean,&nbsp;I never
        cease to be amazed&nbsp;at the <span class="explainq4 explain">extraordinary</span> encounters that I have while
        I’m at sea.&nbsp;But more and more frequently these days&nbsp;I’m seeing terrible things underwater as
        well,&nbsp;things that I don’t think most people realize.&nbsp;And I’ve been <span
            class="explainq5 explain">compelled</span> to turn my camera towards these issues&nbsp;to tell a more
        complete story.&nbsp;I want people to see what’s happening underwater,&nbsp;both the horror and the magic.</p>
