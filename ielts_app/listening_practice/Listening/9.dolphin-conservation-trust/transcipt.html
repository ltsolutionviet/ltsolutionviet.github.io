  <p>Today we're pleased to have on the show Alice Bussell from the Dolphin Conservation Trust. Tell us about the Trust,
    Alice.</p>
  <p>Well, obviously its purpose is to protect dolphins in seas all around the&nbsp;world. It tries to raise people’s
    awareness of the problems these marine&nbsp;creatures are suffering because of pollution and other threats. It
    started&nbsp;ten years ago and it’s one of the fastest growing animal charities in the&nbsp;country - although it's
    still fairly small compared with the big players&nbsp;in animal protection. We are particularly proud of the work we
    do in&nbsp;education - last year we visited a huge number of schools in different&nbsp;parts of the country, going
    round to talk to children and young people&nbsp;aged from five to eighteen. In fact, about thirty-five per cent of
    our&nbsp;members are children. <span class="explainq1 explain">&nbsp;The charity uses its money to support
      campaigns&nbsp;- for example, for changes in fishing policy and so forth.</span></p>
  <p>It hopes soon to&nbsp;be able to employ its first full-time biologist - with dolphin expertise - to&nbsp;monitor
    populations. Of course, many people give their services on a&nbsp;voluntary basis and <span
      class="explainq2 explain">&nbsp;we now have volunteers working in observation, office&nbsp;work and other
      things.</span></p>
  <p>I should also tell you about the award we won from the Charity Commission last year - for our work in education.
    Although it’s not meant an enormous amount of money for us, <span class="explainq3 explain">it has made our
      activities even more widely publicised and understood.</span></p>
  <p>In the long term it may not bring in extra members but we’re hoping it'll have this effect.</p>
  <p>Is it possible to see dolphins in UK waters?</p>
  <p>Yes. In several locations. And we have a big project in the east part of&nbsp;Scotland. This has long been a haven
    for dolphins because it has very little shipping. However, that may be about to change soon because oil companies
    want to increase exploration there. We’re campaigning against&nbsp;this because, although there’ll be little
    pollution from oil, <span class="explainq4 explain">exploration&nbsp;creates a lot of underwater noise.</span></p>
  <p>It means the dolphins can’t rest and socialise.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is how I became interested in dolphin conservation in the first place.</p>
  <p>I had never seen one and I hadn’t been particularly interested in them at school. <span
      class="explainq5 explain">Then I came across this story about a family of dolphins who had to leave their home in
      the Moray Firth because of the oil companies and about a child who campaigned to save them. I couldn't put the
      book down -&nbsp;I&nbsp;was hooked.</span></p>
  <p>I'm sure our listeners will want to find out what they can do to help. You&nbsp;mentioned the 'Adopt a Dolphin’
    scheme. Can you tell us about that?</p>
  <p>Of course! People can choose one of our dolphins to sponsor. They&nbsp;receive a picture of it and news updates.
    I’d like to tell you about four which are currently being adopted by our members: Moondancer, Echo,&nbsp;Kiwi and
    Samson. Unfortunately, <span class="explainq6 explain">Echo is being rather elusive this year&nbsp;and hasn't vet
      been sighted bv our observers</span></p>
  <p>but we remain optimistic that he’ll be out there soon. All the others have been out in force - Samson and
    Moondancer are often photographed together but it is <span class="explainq7 explain">Kiwi who's our real 'character'
      as she seems to love coming up close for the cameras and we've captured her on film hundreds of times.</span></p>
  <p>They all have their own personalities - Moondancer is very elegant and curves out and into the water very smoothly,
    whereas <span class="explainq8 explain">Samson has a lot of energy - he’s&nbsp;&nbsp;always leaping out of the water
      with great vigour.</span></p>
  <p>You’d probably expect him to be the youngest - he's not quite - that’s Kiwi - but <span
      class="explainq9 explain">Samson’s the latest of our dolphins to be chosen for the scheme.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;Kiwi makes a lot of noise so we can often pick her out straightaway. Echo and Moondancer are noisy too, but
    <span class="explainq10 explain">Moondancer's easy to find because she has a&nbsp;particularly large fin on her
      back, which makes her easy to identify.</span></p>
  <p>So, yes, they're all very different... interviewer: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, they sound a fascinating group
    ...&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
