  <p><em>You will hear part of a radio programme about Do-It-Yourself house painting.</em></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaker: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Good morning
      everyone, and welcome to our weekly series on home improvements.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s programme is about Do-It-Yourself house painting ... There’s never been a
      better time for people who like to do their own interior house painting. Although people still lead very busy
      lives,<span class="explainq1 explain"> thanks to the availability of various new DIY materials, you can now
        decorate your home in a more efficient and a more environmentally-friendly way</span>.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In two thousand and nine alone,<span class="explainq2 explain"> approximately
        fifty-three million litres of the paint that was sold in the UK were left untouched</span> - that’s enough to
      fill twenty one Olympic-sized swimming pools.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's easy to overestimate how much paint you’ll need to decorate your room if you
      use guesswork. And if you know exactly how much paint is needed, you avoid unnecessary waste. <span
        class="explainq3 explain">There are automatic paint calculators available now - most of the major paint
        manufacturers provide them - look on their websites, or just google ‘paint calculator’ and see what comes
        up</span>. Then simply measure the circumference and height of the room in metres, enter this into the
      calculator along with the type of surface you're painting, and it will tell you how many litres of paint you’ll
      need.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you do end up with leftover paint, you can donate it to an organisation like
      Community RePaint.<span class="explainq4 explain"> They will take the paint from you and redistribute it to local
        charities and voluntary organisations</span>, so it goes to a good home. You can find more information about
      Community RePaint on communityrepaint - all one word - dot org dot uk.</span>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaker: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Another way of
      avoiding paint wastage is to check you're completely happy with your colour&nbsp;</span><span
      style="font-weight: 400;">choice before starting to paint. For example,<span class="explainq5 explain"> you can
        get a small sample of the colour you’re thinking of using</span>, then paint a board and move it around the
      room, so you can see how it looks against your furnishings, and in different lights. Also, it’s always better to
      buy high quality paints, because you get what you pay for. If you buy cheap paint you might need to apply two or
      three coats to achieve the same coverage that you’d get from one coat of a good-quality paint. You could also
      spend a week on a job that could have been done in a day or two. And consider the environment. <span
        class="explainq6 explain">Most paint manufacturers now sell water-based paints that don’t contain harmful
        chemicals or give off harmful odours, so get one of these</span>. You can also buy paint that’s packaged in
      recyclable containers. There’s a lot more choice than there used to be.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can only do a good job, which will last, if you prepare the surfaces thoroughly
      before painting. In fact, in many ways if you want to do a professional-looking job, this is more important than
      the painting itself. If there are any cracks or patches of loose plaster, painting over them won’t solve the
      problem. <span class="explainq7 explain">Take the plaster out and fill the holes</span>, allowing enough time for
      the new plaster to dry. And you won’t get a smooth finish if the walls are dusty or greasy, so washing with water
      isn’t enough. <span class="explainq8 explain">Use a solution of decorator’s soap</span> and rinse well with warm
      water afterwards.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you're ready to paint, we suggest you use a medium-pile roller for walls and
      ceilings. A lot of people tend to use short-pile rollers, but these give a patchy finish, and that wastes paint
      and time. Similarly, long-pile rollers can create a thick, textured effect, which looks messy. The same goes for
      brushes. The stronger the bristles, the easier they are to wash and reuse. And as you’ve chosen a water-based
      paint, <span class="explainq9 explain">clean your brushes with cold water</span>, because it’s more
      energy-efficient that way. As you're decorating, keep transferring small amounts of paint into a tray and keep
      topping it up when you need to. This reduces the chance of it being contaminated by dust and pieces of dirt ...
      And finally, water-based paint doesn’t have a lingering smell, so that's not an issue any more, but it’s air flow
      rather than heat that helps the paint dry quicker, so to help finish the job in the quickest time <span
        class="explainq10 explain">leave your doors and windows open</span>. The faster the paint is dry and the job
      finished, the quicker you can start enjoying your room!</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In tomorrow’s programme I’ll be giving some advice ...</span></p>
