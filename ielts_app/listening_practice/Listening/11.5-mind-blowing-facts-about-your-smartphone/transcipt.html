    NASA uses them as <span class="explainq1 explain">chief satellites</span>.
    The smartphone industry has pushed the boundaries of low-cost,
    high-performance solutions. So far, that the average smartphone has more
    computing power and memory than the average satellite.

    NASA noticed the unique anomaly in modern technology. And in
    <span class="explainq2 explain">2009</span>, they created project Phonesat.
    This project is an on-going experiment that uses a smartphone as a satellite
    on-board computer. There have been multiple versions to launch as new phones
    are released, the orbital lifespan is said to be one year. It's pretty cool.

    <strong>Smartphones are the fastest growing industry in history.</strong>
    And today, the industry is worth over
    <span class="explainq2 explain explainq3">300 billion </span>dollars. To
    really understand just how big that is, we have to compare it to the next
    closest thing humanity has seen, the PC market. Compare to the PC market,
    the smartphone industry has been growing at a rate of four times the maximum
    rate of PC growth.

    In <span class="explainq4 explain">January 2014</span>, for the first time
    in history, mobile phone Internet usage overtook PC Internet usage. That's
    not all, In the period between 1975 and June 2008, one billion PCs were
    sold, this included desktops, laptops, servers and everything combined.

    In comparison, smartphone sales topped 1 billion in just 2013 alone. The
    sales have been so rapid that even on YouTube, some smartphone reviewers
    have been made celebrities in their own right. Smartphones are only getting
    more popular with low-cost, high-performance options such as the Nexus 5 and
    Sony Xperia Z compact.

    Smartphones are actually slowly changing the world. In 2014, mobile traffic
    is almost 15% of the continent of Africa's studies.&nbsp;In
    <span class="explainq6 explain">Egypt</span>, 70% of people say they don't
    even touch desktop or laptops to access the web, they only use mobile.

    In May 2012, a study from the University of Colorado found that the average
    person belonging to Generation Y has the phone with them 91% of the day. And
    they're very likely would use their phones to meet up with each other,
    settle arguments or solve unexpected problems.

    Generation Y and Z, basically my generation, has grown up with the Internet
    and the smartphone was basically the next logical step. Some says that is
    making this generation less social, but that's really up to the individual.

    In addition to this, smartphones have made colossal dens in the sales of
    point and shoot cameras, camcorders, newspapers, print media in general,
    netbooks, prodigal gaming systems, mp3 players and basically most things you
    can think of.

    Now, of course, the smartphone would have been able to do this by itself. It
    is the smartphone plus the collective knowledge of everyone through the
    Internet that has caused this shift.

    Your smartphone is more powerful than you think. This one will blow your
    mind!
  </p>
  <p
    class="subtitle-listing-item subtitle-listing-number-EN64"

    For this fact, we have to go back on a journey through time and space, like
    we often do on this channel.

  <p
    class="subtitle-listing-item subtitle-listing-number-EN65"

    So the year <span class="explainq8 explain">1946</span> and on this year,
    the first ever, general-purpose fully electronic computer was created. Its
    name was Eniac. The Eniac computer took up an entire room and required
    colossal amounts of energy, just to complete 385 calculations per second.
  </p>
  <p
    class="subtitle-listing-item subtitle-listing-number-EN68"
    data-sub-number="68"
  >
    Fast forward to last year, so 2013 and the Snapdragon 800 chip that is not
    uncommon in most smartphones, can do 28 billion calculations per second. In
    other words, it would take
    <span class="explainq8 explain explainq9">72 million</span> Eniac computers
    just to make up of the power of one smartphone chip.
  </p>
  <p
    class="subtitle-listing-item subtitle-listing-number-EN71"
    data-sub-number="71"

    Let's push this fact a little bit further. That's over 2 billion tons of
    Eniac computer components and you don't even want to guess how much space
    this will take up. Or practicality aside, if you could place all the Eniac
    computers back to back and as close as you couldn't possibly get them, all
    the components together would take up a landmass of how big?
  </p>
  <p
    class="subtitle-listing-item subtitle-listing-number-EN75"

    Maybe you'd guess a football stadium, or maybe a small city. Not even close.

  <p
    class="subtitle-listing-item subtitle-listing-number-EN77"
    data-sub-number="77"

    To have the equipment power of one smartphone chip, it would take 11.8
    million square kilometers of Eniac computer components. That's
    <span class="explainq10 explain"
      >20% larger than the entire area of the United States of America</span
    >. And all that now can fit when you thinking now. It's definitely something
    to think about.
