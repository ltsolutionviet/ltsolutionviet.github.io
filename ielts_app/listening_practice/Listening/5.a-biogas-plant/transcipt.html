    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hello Eve, come in and sit down ... How’s it going?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fine thanks. I’m looking forward to my teaching practice next week.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good. Now you’ve got two classes, haven’t you - Year 3 and Year 6. Have you done
            your lesson plans?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I’ve decided to take the topic of <strong>renewable energy</strong> ... I
            haven’t done a lesson plan for Year six yet, but I thought I’d base their lesson on an example of very
            simple technology. So I’ve brought this diagram to show you ... I got it from the Internet.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s see ... <strong>A biogas plant</strong> ... So this is equipment for
            producing fuel from organic waste? </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes. <span class="explainq1 explain">The smaller container on the left is where
                you put the waste you’ve collected</span> ...</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right, and from there it’s piped into the larger tank?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s right. And that’s <span class="explainq2 explain">slurry</span> on the
            base of the larger tank.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right ... and what exactly is slurry?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a mixture of organic waste and water.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So is <span class="explainq3 explain">that pipe at the bottom where the water
                comes in</span>?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes it is ... As the slurry mixture digests it produces <span
                class="explainq4 explain">gas, and that rises to the top of the <strong>dome</strong></span>. Then when
            it’s needed it can be piped off for use as fuel in homes or factories. It’s very simple.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I suppose there’s some kind of safety <strong>valve</strong> to prevent pressure
            build-up?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s the <span class="explainq5 explain">overflow tank</span>. That container
            on the <strong>right</strong>. As the slurry expands some of it flows into that, and then once some of the
            gas has been <strong>piped off</strong>, the slurry level goes down again and the overflow tank empties
            again.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see. Well I think that’s suitably simple for the age level it’s for. I look
            forward to seeing the whole lesson plan.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks. And can I show you my ideas for the Year three lesson?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course. Let’s look.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought I’d introduce the topic by writing the word ‘<strong>energy</strong>’
            on the board, and <strong>reinforcing</strong> the spelling and the pronunciation. Then I’ll do a little
            mime - you know, <span class="explainq6 explain">run on the spot or something - to convey the
                sense</span>.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’d keep it brief at this stage ...</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, I will. Then I’ll <strong>wipe</strong> the word off and write the question
            ‘Where does energy come from?’, and see what the pupils come up with.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fine. I’d suggest that you just brainstorm at this stage, and don’t reject any of
            their suggestions.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, that’s what I was going to do ... Then<span class="explainq7 explain"> I’ve
                produced a set of simple statements</span>, like ‘Energy makes cars move along the road’, and ‘Energy
            makes our bodies grow’. There are eight altogether.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you going to give them out as a handout? Or write them up on the
            board?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, I’ll put them on the board, and then I’ll read them out loud. <span
                class="explainq8 explain">And I’ll get the pupils to copy them out in their note books. I’ll also ask
                them to think up one more similar statement by themselves, and add it to the list.</span></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good idea.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eve: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
        <span style="font-weight: 400;">After that I thought I’d vary things a bit by sticking some pictures up ... of
            things like the sun&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and plants and food, and petrol, and a
            running child. And <span class="explainq9 explain">I’ll get the pupils to work out what order the pictures
                should come in, in terms of the energy chain.</span></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tutor: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span
            style="font-weight: 400;">I think that’s a very good idea. You could move the pictures around as the pupils
            give you&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directions.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eve: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
        <span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, I think they’d enjoy that. And to finish off <span
                class="explainq10 explain">I’ve made a gap-fill exercise to give out.</span></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’ll be doing that individually, and while they’re writing I’ll walk round and
            check their work.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tutor: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span
            style="font-weight: 400;">Good ... And have you worked out the timing of all that? It’ll probably take you
            right through&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to the end of the...</span></p>
