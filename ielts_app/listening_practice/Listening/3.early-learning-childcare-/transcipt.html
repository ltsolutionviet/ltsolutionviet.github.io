  <p>Good morning. Welcome to the Early Learning Childcare Centre. How may I help you?</p>
  <p>Hi. I spoke to you last week about enrolling my daughter for next year.</p>
  <p>Oh, yes. I’ll just get some details from you. So, you're her mother?</p>
  <p>That’s right.</p>
  <p>And, can I have your name?</p>
  <p>It’s Carol, Carol Smith.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>And your daughter’s name?</p>
  <p>It's Kate.</p>
  <p>Now, we have several groups at the centre and we cater for children from three to five years old. How old is your
    daughter?</p>
  <p>She’s three now but she turns four next month.</p>
  <p><span class="explainq1 explain"><strong>I’ll put four down because that's how old she'll be when she
        starts.</strong></span></p>
  <p>Fine, she’s so excited about her birthday and coming to the centre.</p>
  <p>That’s good to hear. And what's your address?</p>
  <p>It’s <span class="explainq2 explain"><strong>46 Wombat Road,</strong></span> that's W-O-M-B-A-T. Woodside 4032.</p>
  <p>And what’s the phone number?</p>
  <p>Oh ... it’s ... 3345 9865.</p>
  <p>So, have you decided on the days you’d like to bring your daughter here?</p>
  <p>I’d prefer Monday and Wednesday if possible.</p>
  <p>Mmm. I'll check, Monday’s fine, but I think the centre is already full for Wednesday. Erm. Yes. Sorry. It seems to
    be a very popular day. We can offer you a Thursday or a Friday as well.</p>
  <p>Oh dear. <span class="explainq3 explain"><strong>I suppose Thursday would be all right</strong></span> because she
    has swimming on Friday.</p>
  <p>OK, got that. Because a lot of parents work, we do offer flexible start and finish times. We are open from 7:30 in
    the morning until 6 o'clock at night.</p>
  <p>What time would you like your daughter to start?</p>
  <p>I need to get to work in the city by 9:00 so <span class="explainq4 explain"><strong>I'll drop her off at
        8:30.</strong></span></p>
  <p>You’re &nbsp;pretty close to the city here so that should give me plenty of time to get there.</p>
  <p>That’s fine. Now, we also need to decide which group she'll be in. We have two different groups and they’re divided
    up according to age. There’s the green group, which is for three to four-year-olds. And then there’s the red group
    which is for four- to five-year-olds.</p>
  <p>She’s quite mature for her age and she can already write her name and read a little.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, <span class="explainq5 explain"><strong>I’ll put her in the red
          group</strong></span> and we can always change her to the green one if there are any problems.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That sounds fine.</span></p>
  <p>Ok. Let's move on to meals. We can provide breakfast, lunch and dinner.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she’s finishing pretty early, she won't need dinner, will you give her breakfast
      before she comes?</span></p>
  <p><span class="explainq6 explain"><strong>Yes, she'll only need lunch.</strong></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, does she have any medical conditions we need to know about? Does she have
      asthma or any hearing problems for example?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No. <span class="explainq7 explain"><strong>But she does need to wear
          glasses.</strong></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, I'll make a note of that.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, she's pretty good about wearing them, she can’t see much without them.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right. OK. Now, I also need emergency contact details.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what sort of information do you need?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just the name and number of a friend or family member we can contact in case we
      can’t get hold of you at any time.</span></p>
  <ol start="7523">
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> That’d better be my sister... Jenny <span
          class="explainq8 explain"><strong>Ball</strong></span>. That’s B-A-double L. Her phone number is 3346
        7523.</span></li>
  </ol>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great.<span class="explainq9 explain"><strong> So she is the child's
          aunt?</strong></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, that’s right.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ll make a note of that as well. Now, is ther&amp;anything you’d like to ask? What
      about payment? How much are the fees each term?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, for two days and the hours you’ve chosen, that will be $450
      altogether.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OK, and do I have lo pay that now?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, we send out invoices once the children start at the centre. You can choose to
      pay at the end of each term or we do offer a slightly discounted rate<span class="explainq10 explain"><strong> if
          you pay</strong> <strong>every month.</strong></span></span></p>
  <p>Oh. I’ll do that then. I f<span style="font-weight: 400;">ind it easier to budget that way and I’m not used to the
      term dates just yet.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good, it makes it a lot simpler for us as well. Well, that’s everything.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would you like me to show you around ...?</span></p>
