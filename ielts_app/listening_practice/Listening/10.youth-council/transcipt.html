    <p>CAROLINE:</p>
    <p>Good Morning. Youth Council. Caroline speaking.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROGER:</p>
    <p>Oh, hello, I’m interested in standing for election to the Youth Council, and I was told to give you a call.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>CAROLINE:</p>
    <p>That’s good. Could I have your name, please?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROGER:</p>
    <p>Yes, it’s Roger <span class="explainqe explain">Brown</span>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>CAROLINE:</p>
    <p>Thank you. I’m Caroline, the Youth Council administrator. So do you know much about what the Council does, Roger?
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROGER:</p>
    <p>I’ve talked to Stephanie - l think she’s the chair of the Council.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>CAROLINE:</p>
    <p>That's right.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROGER:</p>
    <p>And she told me a lot about it. How it’s a way for young people to discuss local issues, for example, and make
        suggestions to the town council. That's what made&nbsp;me interested.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>CAROLINE:</p>
    <p>Fine. Well let me take down some of your details. First of all, how old are you. You know the Council is for
        young people aged from 13 to 18?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROGER:</p>
    <p>I’ve just turned 18.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>CAROLINE:</p>
    <p>And where do you live, Roger?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROGER:</p>
    <p>Well, that’s a bit complicated. At the moment I’m looking for a flat to rent here, so I’m in a <span
            class="explainq1 explain">hostel</span> from Monday to Friday. I go back to my parents’ place at
        the&nbsp;weekend.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>CAROLINE:</p>
    <p>OK so where’s the best place to send you some information about the Council.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROGER:</p>
    <p>Oh to my parents’ address, please. That's 17, <span class="explainq2 explain">Buckleigh </span>Street -
        B-U-C-K-L-E-l-G-H Street, Stamford, Lincolnshire, though you don’t really need the county.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>CAROLINE:</p>
    <p>Oh, I know Stamford - it’s a lovely town. And what’s the postcode?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROGER:</p>
    <p><span class="explainq3 explain">PE9 7QT</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>CAROLINE:</p>
    <p>Right, thank you. So are you working here, or are you a student.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROGER:</p>
    <p>I started studying at the university a couple of weeks ago, and I've got a part-time job for a few hours a week.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>CAROLINE:</p>
    <p>What do you do?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROGER:</p>
    <p>Well, I’ve done several different things. I've just finished a short-term contract as a courier, and now I’m
        working as a <span class="explainq4 explain">waiter</span> in one of the big hotels.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>CAROLINE:</p>
    <p>Uhuh. That can't leave you much time for studying!</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROGER:</p>
    <p>Oh, it’s not too bad. I manage to fit it all in.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>CAROLINE:</p>
    <p>What are you studying?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROGER:</p>
    <p>My ambition is to go into parliament eventually, so my major subject is <span
            class="explainq5 explain">politics</span>. That’s partly why I&nbsp;think the Youth Council is important and
        want to be a part of it.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>CAROLINE:</p>
    <p>And I suppose you’re also taking a minor subject, aren’t you? I know a lot of people study economics too.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROGER:</p>
    <p>I chose history. To be honest, I’m not finding it as interesting as I expected!</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>CAROLINE:</p>
    <p>OK, so with your studying and your part-time job, do you have time for any other interests or hobbies?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROGER:</p>
    <p>Well. I spend quite a lot of time <span class="explainq6 explain">cycling</span> - both around town to get to
        university and to work, and also long-distance, from here to London, for instance.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>CAROLINE:</p>
    <p>That’s pretty impressive! Anything else?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROGER:</p>
    <p>For relaxation I’m also keen on the <span class="explainq7 explain">cinema</span> - I used to go at least once a
        week, but I can’t manage to go so often now.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>CAROLINE:</p>
    <p>Right. Are you sure you’ll have enough time for the Youth Council?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROGER:</p>
    <p>Yes, I’ve worked out that I can afford to reduce my hours at work, and that will make the time.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>CAROLINE:</p>
    <p>So is there any particular aspect of the Youth Council’s work that appeals to you, Roger?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROGER:</p>
    <p>Well, my sister is blind, so I’m particularly interested in working with <span
            class="explainq8 explain">disabled</span> young people, to try and improve the quality of their lives.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>CAROLINE:</p>
    <p>That’s great. Well, the best way to get involved is to be nominated by some people who you know.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROGER:</p>
    <p>Right. Can you tell me how to set about organising that?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>CAROLINE:</p>
    <p>You should talk to Jeffrey, our Elections Officer. I can arrange a meeting in the council office with him, if you
        like.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROGER:</p>
    <p>Yes, please.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>CAROLINE:</p>
    <p>He’ll be here next Monday, if that suits you.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROGER:</p>
    <p>That’s the 14th, isn’t it?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>CAROLINE:</p>
    <p>Yes.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROGER:</p>
    <p>I can manage late afternoon.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>CAROLINE:</p>
    <p>Would you like to suggest a time? He generally leaves around 5.30.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROGER:</p>
    <p>Well, would<span class="explainq9 explain"> 4.30</span> be OK? My last class finishes at 4. so I’d have plenty of
        time to get to your office.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>CAROLINE:</p>
    <p>Right, that’s fine. Oh, and could I have a phone number we can contact you on?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROGER:</p>
    <p>Yes, my mobile number’s <span class="explainq10 explain">07788 136711</span>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>CAROLINE:</p>
    <p>Thank you. Well, we’ll look forward to seeing you next week.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROGER:</p>
    <p>Thanks very much. Goodbye.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>CAROLINE:</p>
    <p>Bye.</p>
