    <p>Hi. Great to see you! I’m Jody, and I’ll be looking after both of you for the first month you’re working here at
        the Amersham Theatre. I’ll tell you something about the theatre now, then&nbsp;take you to meet two of the other
        staff.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It’s an old building, and it’s been modernised several times. In fact, as you can see, we’re carrying out a major
        refurbishment at the moment. The interior has just been repainted, and&nbsp;we’re about to start on the exterior
        of the building - that’ll be a big job. The work’s running&nbsp;over budget, so we’ve had to postpone installing
        an elevator. I hope you’re happy running&nbsp;up and down stairs! When the theatre was built, people were
        generally slimmer and shorter</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>than now, and the seats were very close together. We’ve replaced them with<span class="explainq1 explain"> larger
            seats, with more legroom</span>. This means fewer seats in total, but we’ve taken the opportunity to
        install&nbsp;seats that can easily be moved, to create different acting spaces. We’ve also turned a
        few&nbsp;storerooms over to <span class="explainq2 explain">other purposes, like using them for meetings</span>.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We try hard to involve members of the public in the theatre. One way is by organising <span
            class="explainq3 explain">backstage tours</span>, so people can be shown round the building and learn how a
        theatre&nbsp;operates. These are proving very popular. What we’re finding is that people want to have&nbsp;lunch
        or a cup of coffee while they’re here, so we re looking into the possibility of opening&nbsp;a cafe in due
        course. We have a <span class="explainq4 explain">bookshop</span>, which specialises in books about drama, and
        that attracts plenty of customers. Then there are two large rooms that will be decorated next&nbsp;month, and
        they'll be available for hire, for conferences and private functions, such as parties.&nbsp;We re also
        considering hiring out costumes to amateur drama clubs.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Now I want to tell you about our workshops. We recently started a programme of workshops that anyone can join.
        Eventually we intend to run courses in acting, but we’re waiting until&nbsp;we’ve got the right people in place
        as trainers. That’s proving more difficult than we’d&nbsp;expected! There’s a big demand to learn about the
        technical side of putting on a production,&nbsp;and our <span class="explainq5 explain">lighting</span> workshop
        has already started, with great success. We re going to start one&nbsp;on sound next month. A number of people
        have enquired about workshops on make-up,&nbsp;and that’s something we’re considering for the future. A surprise
        success is the workshop on <span class="explainq6 explain">making puppets</span> - we happen to have someone
        working here who does it as a hobby, and she offered to run a workshop. It was so popular we re now running them
        every month!</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Now, a word about the layout of the building. The auditorium, stage and dressing rooms for the actors are all
        below ground level. Here on the ground floor we have most of the rooms&nbsp;that the public doesn’t see. The
        majority are internal, so they have windows in the roof to light</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Standing here in the foyer, you’re probably wondering why the <span class="explainq7 explain">box office</span>
        isn't here, where the public would expect to find it. Well, you might have noticed it on your way in - although
        it's&nbsp;part of this building, it’s next door, with a separate entrance from the road.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>For the <span class="explainq8 explain">theatre manager's office</span>, you go across the foyer and through the
        double doors, turn right, and it's the room at the end of the corridor, with the door on the left.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The <span class="explainq9 explain">lighting box</span> is where the computerised stage lighting is operated, and
        it’s at the back of the building When you’re through the double doors, turn left, turn right at the water
        cooler,&nbsp;and right again at the end. It’s the second room along that corridor. The lighting box has
        a&nbsp;window into the auditorium, which of course is below us.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The <span class="explainq10 explain">artistic director’s office</span> is through the double doors, turn right,
        and it’s the first room you come to on the right-hand side. And finally, for the moment, the room where I’ll
        take you next&nbsp;- the relaxation room. So if you’d like to come with me ...</p>
