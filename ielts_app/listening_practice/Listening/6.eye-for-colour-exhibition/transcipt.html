  <p>Narrator:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will hear someone talking about
    a&nbsp;colour exhibition.</p>
  <p>Announcer: Now. I'd like to welcome onto our show today Darren Whitlock, who's going to tell us about a very
    vibrant exhibition.</p>
  <p>Darren: Thanks. Melanie. Yes. in fact, it's an exhibition called 'Eye for colour'. It’s packed with hands-on
    exhibits and interactive displays and it explores the endless ways in which colour shapes our world.</p>
  <p>Now. there are 40 exhibits altogether that come under six main sections. Sadly. I haven't got time to tell you
    about them all today, so let me just give you a taste of what's on offer.</p>
  <p>So to start off. there's a section simply entitled 'Seeing colour', which is. well - as the title suggests - about
    how we do just that. And it’s a good starting point, because basically, you look at the museum gallery through a
    giant <span class="explainq1 explain">eyeball</span> that’s standing on a circular foot What you don't&nbsp;know is
    that this houses a 32" camera and screen, and the overall effect of these is quite amazing.</p>
  <p>Another section that’s very interesting is called 'Colour in culture'. Here, there are a number of activities
    designed to illustrate the powerful links that exist between colour and certain aspects of our <span
      class="explainq2 explain">lifestyle</span>, and this is done through a range of images and objects. You can visit
    the color cafe that contains meals that really make you question&nbsp;how conditioned you are. How hungry do you
    feel you're faced with a plate of pink and green fried eggs and blue sausages, for example? This section also
    includes activities that give visitors some idea of what it's like to view the world with a visual <span
      class="explainq3 explain">disability</span>, which is something that many people have to do.</p>
  <p>Then there's a 'Colour in nature' section, designed to illustrate the many amazing colours that we see everywhere
    around us - from rainbows to autumn leaves - and to give us an idea of what its like surviving in the external
    environment. So you can try camouflaging yourself. This really is one for the kids - dressing up ir a suit and then
    selecting a <span class="explainq4 explain">background</span> where, to all intents and purposes, you disappear. And
    you can look at the world through the eyes of a dog or fish .. what do these creatures really see?</p>
  <p>I’d recommend ending the trip with a visit to the '<span class="explainq5 explain">mood</span> room', which
    explores the influence of colour on the way we feel. Here, you can lie back and listen to music as a projector
    subtly alters the <span class="explainq6 explain">lighting</span> in the room and with it. the atmosphere. How does
    each colour affect your emotions? You'll be surprised!&nbsp;</p>
