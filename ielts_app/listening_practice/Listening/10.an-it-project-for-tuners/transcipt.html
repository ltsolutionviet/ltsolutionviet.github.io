    <h2>An IT project for Tuners</h2>

  <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will hear a business studies student called Sam talking to his tutor about
        an IT project&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he is going to do for a local company called Turners.
      </span></em></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hello Sam, come in and sit down ...</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re here to discuss your company-based IT project aren’t you?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes ... I’ve been to see the Manager and he’s given me a lot of ideas about
      projects that the company would find useful. But I wanted to ask your opinion about them before I choose
      one.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, that’s fine. Now this company’s called Turners isn’t it?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s right. It’s a small engineering company - they make machine components for
      trade use. They’re well established - they started in nineteen seventy-six - but they’re a bit old
      fashioned.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OK ... And what kind of projects did Turners suggest you could do for the
      company?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, they want some improvements made to their <span
        class="explainq1 explain">customer database</span>. The one that they’ve got at the moment isn’t very useful in
      some ways. I had a quick look at it ...</span></p>
  <p>That would be a very straightforward project, and it’d be simple enough to evaluate, but I don’t think you’d get
    enough out of a project like that. You wouldn’t learn anything new.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well another project they suggested is to do with their <span
        class="explainq2 explain">online sales catalogue</span>. At the moment customers can look at their products but
      they can’t actually order them online, which must affect their competitiveness. But </span>I said I thought it
    would take too long, it’s quite a big task.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re right. It’s too much for the time you’ve got. It’s a pity though.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then they want some help with their <span class="explainq3 explain">payroll
        system</span>. At the moment the way they calculate pay involves a lot of manual accounting. I suggested they
      could have a system where employees register electronically when they arrive and leave work, so the hours they do
      could be transferred automatically.</span></p>
  <p>I think you’d get a lot out of a project like that - it would extend your skills but it wouldn’t be too much to
    take on. A student did something similar a couple of years ago, but this is slig<span style="font-weight: 400;">htly
      different.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, then they need help with their <span class="explainq4 explain">stock
        inventory</span>. They do everything manually ...</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Really?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes! And it takes so much time.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s probably very inaccurate too ... </span>An electronic inventory would probably
    be the biggest single benefit for the company. I’m surprised they haven’t had it done before.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know! Then they wanted to improve their <span class="explainq5 explain">internal
        security</span>. The Manager had visited other companies where the staff use swipe cards to access various areas
      of the building ... It sounded useful, but the trouble is, I’m not really sure how to do it.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I think you’re right in that assessm</span>ent. At the moment it’s probably a
    bit beyond your level of knowledge. Is that all?</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just one more ... <span class="explainq6 explain">Customer Service</span>. They
      want to be able to collect feedback from their customers in a more systematic way. At the moment it’s a bit of a
      mess, and they probably lose business as a result.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would that involve you </span>going to see customers at their own premises? Because
    in that case you might have to do a fair amount of travelling, and that would incur expenses that haven’t been
    agreed with these companies.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I never thought of that ...</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well it might not be a problem, but it’s something that needs clarifying ... Well I
      hope that’s been helpful in narrowing down the options?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes it has, thanks. I’ll be able to make a decision now. But while I’m here, can I
      talk to you about coursework?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure .</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span
      style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not very happy about the way our group assignment is working. There are
      some&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">problems .</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tutor: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span
      style="font-weight: 400;">Oh dear. Are people just not getting on with each other? That’s the worst thing
      ...</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span
      style="font-weight: 400;">Actually we’re all friends, it’s not that, but when we’re having a discussion about
    </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">assignment one or two people
      end up doing all the talking, and the rest don’t say anything. It’s a bit frustrating, because we need plenty of
      debate ...</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tutor: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span
      style="font-weight: 400;">Well that’s a common observation. You’re studying in </span><span
      class="explainq7 explain">a group with people from all over the&nbsp;world,</span> and you all have your own ways
    of participating. In some places students are more used to listening than talking, and vice versa.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span
      style="font-weight: 400;">Mmm. I suppose you’re right ... I’ll try to remember that ...</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tutor: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span
      style="font-weight: 400;">Does everyone pull their weight as far as sharing the workload is concerned?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span
      style="font-weight: 400;">I’d say they do, yes. And our group elected a leader. She’s very good at
      making&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sure no&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">one’s
      overloaded ... But personally I feel that <span class="explainq8 explain">there are just too many of us in the
        group</span>. Whenever we try to arrange a meeting there’s always at least one person who can’t make it. It’s
      not anyone’s fault. It’s just that we’ve all got slightly different timetables.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tutor: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span
      style="font-weight: 400;">Well I’m glad you’ve talked to me about it. Feedback is always useful. Is there anything
      else&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you’re concerned about?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span
      style="font-weight: 400;">There are a couple of problems with lecturers that all the students are talking about
      ...</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tutor: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span
      style="font-weight: 400;">Last semester we had negative feedback about the way lectures were organised.
      There&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were several occasions when the wrong room had been booked, or
      the same room had been booked twice ... that sort of thing. Is that still a problem?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span
      style="font-weight: 400;">That hasn’t happened at all as far as I know ...</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tutor: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span
      style="font-weight: 400;">Oh good, it’s sorted out then.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span
      style="font-weight: 400;">But ... I don’t know the reason, but </span><span class="explainq9 explain">some of the
      staff often turn up late,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so we</span>&nbsp;<span
      style="font-weight: 400;">miss ten or&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fifteen minutes of our lecture
      time ... It might be because they’ve been copying handouts for students, I think there’s a queue for the machine
      sometimes ...</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tutor: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span
      style="font-weight: 400;">Well I’ll look into that. Thank you for telling me. Anything else?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span
      style="font-weight: 400;">The other thing is that <span class="explainq10 explain">it can be very difficult to get
        to see a lecturer individually</span>. They’re all&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">very supportive
      and friendly when you do manage to find them, but often they’re not in their office, even at times when they’re
      meant to be available for consultation.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tutor: &nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">OK ... That’s helpful ... Now
      before you leave, let me...</span></p>
