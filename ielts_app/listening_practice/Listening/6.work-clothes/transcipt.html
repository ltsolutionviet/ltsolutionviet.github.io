  <p>For some people, it’s easy to get dressed for work. Pilots and police officers, for example, don’t have to make
    decisions about their work clothes. They wear <span class="explainq1 explain">uniforms</span> to work every day.</p>
  <p>For many office workers, however, it is more difficult to choose clothes for work. They do not wear uniforms to the
    office. Also, many employers are changing their dress codes.<span class="explainq2 explain"> They are allowing their
      employees to wear casual clothes to work.</span></p>
  <p>The change to casual work clothes began in the 1990s. At first, many companies in the United States <span
      class="explainq3 explain">allowed employees to wear casual clothes on one day of the week—Friday</span>. Friday
    became “Casual Friday” or “Dress-down Friday”. Today, however, many companies are allowing their employees to wear
    casual clothes every day of the week.</p>
  <p>Why are companies allowing their employees to wear casual clothes?</p>
  <p>Some studies show that people are more productive when they are wearing comfortable clothes. Employees also like
    the casual dress code because <span class="explainq4 explain">they don’t need to buy special clothes for
      work</span>. They can save money this way.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, a casual dress code can also cause problems. <span class="explainq5 explain">Sometimes employees
      dress too casually</span>. They think they can wear anything. Many companies have rules about casual clothes. They
    list the kinds of clothes that are not “business-casual” clothes. Blue jeans, sandals, and sportswear are examples
    of clothes that are usually too casual for the office.</p>
