  <p>So I thought that I’d first say a few words to help orientate you round the banking system As new arrivals, one of
    the first things you’ll want to do is open a bank account. This will allow you to receive your money transfers, pay
    your bills by direct debit and all sorts of other things that will make your life easier.&nbsp;<br><br>One mistake I
    think a lot of people make is to just wander into the first bank they see, thinking that al! banks are much the
    same, and ask to open an account, in actual fact, they all offer something slightly different, and some of the
    differences can affect you quite seriously For example, for those of you who are studying at the university here,
    you may have noticed that there are two or three banks with branches near the university:&nbsp;<br><br>- Great
    Western and Moneysafe, for example - but only one <br><br>- <span class="explainq1 explain">Finley's - actually has
      an office inside one of the university buildings.</span> For the others, you’d have a bit more of a walk
    <br><br><span class="explainq2 explain">Some banks give away free gifts: Evergreen offers a laptop to people who
      keep a balance of more than £5,000 for nine months; with International Union</span>, you’ll get a phone when you
    open your first account; and one or two others, like Moneysafe and Northern Star, offer mountain bikes or vacuum
    cleaners if you put money on deposit, that sort of thing.&nbsp;<br><br>More seriously, you should look at the sort
    of interest rates the bank will offer you, both if you need an overdraft or loan, or if you're hoping to get some
    interest on your savings. At the moment, Northern Star offers the highest rate of interest to savers, but <span
      class="explainq3 explain">Great Western will lend money at a lower percentage than normal to people registered on
      higher education courses.</span> So you can see it really is worth looking around. <br><br>Another thing it’s a
    good idea to enquire about are bank charges. Again, they're not all the same. Some charge the same across the board,
    such as Evergreen, Finley's and Northern Star, but <span class="explainq4 explain">Moneysafe actually say that if
      you're in credit, your account won't cost a thing</span> - though, just like the others, as soon as you go into
    the red, their prices become pretty steep.</p>
