    <strong>Guide:&nbsp;</strong>Good morning everyone, and welcome to the
    Maritime Museum.&nbsp;Now before we commence our tour I’d just like to tell
    you a little bit about the&nbsp;history of the museum As you can see, it’s a
    very modern building built in the&nbsp;post modern style and it was in fact
    opened by the Prime Minister of Australia&nbsp;in
    <span class="explainq1 explain">November 1991</span>. It’s been designed
    with a nautical flavour in mind to remind us of our links with the sea. But
    the museum isn’t only housed in this building, there are&nbsp;a number of
    <span class="explainq2 explain"
      >historic ships docked outside in the harbour which form part, of
      the&nbsp;museum</span
    >
    and which you are also free to visit, and we’ll be coming to them shortly
    I’d just like to point out one or two things of general interest while we’re
    here.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    Handicapped toilets are located on this floor and the door shows a
    wheelchair. The cloakroom where you can hang your coat or leave your bags is
    just behind us&nbsp;here. The education centre is on the top floor and
    there’s a good little library in&nbsp;there which you might like to use.
    Follow the signs to the Education Centre —&nbsp;you’ll see a lot of little
    <span class="explainq3 explain">green arrows</span> on the wall. The green
    arrows will take you there. The information desk, marked with the small
    letter i on your plan is located&nbsp;right here in the foyer, so if you get
    separated from your friends, I suggest you&nbsp;<span
      class="explainq4 explain"
      >make your way&nbsp;back to the information desk</span
    >
    because we’ll be returning to this spot at the end of the tour. All right?
  </p>
  <p>
    Now if you look out this window you should be able to see where the museum’s
    ships are docked. If you want to go on a tour of the old ship,
    the&nbsp;Vampire, she’s docked over there and you should meet outside on the
    quay.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    However a word of warning! I don’t recommend it for the grandmas
    and&nbsp;grandpas because there are
    <span class="explainq5 explain">lots of stairs</span> to climb. Right, now,
    let’s move on. Oh, I almost forgot to give you the times for that tour. Now,
    tours of the Vampire&nbsp;run
    <span class="explainq6 explain">on the hour every hour</span>. All
    right?&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    Let’s take a walk round the museum now. The first room we’re coming to is
    the theatre. This room is used to screen videos of special interest and we
    also use it for&nbsp;lectures. There’s a continuous video showing today
    about the voyages of
    <span class="explainq7 explain">Captain&nbsp;Cook</span>, so come back here
    later on if you want to learn more about Captain Cook.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, we’re moving along the gallery known as the Leisure Gallery. This is
    one&nbsp;of our permanent exhibitions and here we try to give you an idea of
    the many&nbsp;different ways in which Australians have enjoyed their time
    <span class="explainq8 explain"
      >by the sea: surfing,&nbsp;swimming, lifesaving clubs, that’s all very
      much a part of Australian culture</span
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the end of this section we’ll come to the Picture Gallery where we’ve got
    a marvellous&nbsp;collection of paintings all by
    <span class="explainq9 explain">Australian artists</span>. I think you can
    buy reproductions of some of these paintings in the museum shop. Well worth
    a good look.&nbsp;Now we’re coming to the Members’ Lounge. As a member of
    the museum you&nbsp;would be entitled to use the members’ lounge for
    refreshments. Membership costs&nbsp;$50 a year or
    <span class="explainq10 explain">$70 for all the family</span>. So it’s
    quite good value because entry to the museum is then free.
  </p>
  <p>
    And down at the far end of this floor, you’ll find the section which we’ve
    called&nbsp;Passengers and the Sea. In this part of the museum we’ve
    gathered together a
  </p>
  <p>
    wonderful
    <span class="explainq11 explain">collection of souvenirs</span> from the old
    days when people travelled by ship. You’ll find all sorts of things there:
    old suitcases, ships’ crockery, first class cabins&nbsp;decorated in the
    fashion of the day. Just imagine what it must have been like to&nbsp;travel
    first class.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now I’m going to leave you to walk round the museum on your own for a while
    and we’ll all meet back again at the information desk in three quarters of
    an&nbsp;hour’s time. I hope you enjoy your time with us at the museum today.
    Thank you.
  </p>
