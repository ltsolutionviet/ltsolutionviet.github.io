    <h2>You Can Learn Anything</h2>

  <p>Nobody's born smart. We all start at 0. Can't talk, can't walk, certainly can't do algebra.</p>
  <p>Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <span class="explainq1 explain">Nobody's good at anything at first</span>.
    There was a time when Einstein couldn't count to 10, and Shakespeare had to learn his ABC's just like the rest of
    us.</p>
  <p>Thankfully, we're born to learn. Slowly, surely, you stumble, slip, crawl, fall, and fail, and fall. Frustrating,
    confusing, trying, struggling. Until one day, you walk. One foot in front of the other. One idea on top the next.
    <span class="explainq2 explain">Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger</span>. Failing is just
    another word for growing. And you keep going. This is learning.</p>
  <p>Knowing that you'll get it even if you haven't gotten it yet. Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the
    whole universe are built on basic ideas that <span class="explainq3 explain">anyone can learn</span>, anywhere can
    understand. Whoever you are, whereever you are. You only have to know one thing: You can learn anything.</p>
