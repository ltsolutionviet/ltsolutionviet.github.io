  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For my short presentation today, I’m going to summarise the work I’ve done so far
      on my&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">research project: to explore expertise in creative writing.
      Essentially, I’ll share with you the process I underwent to gather my interim findings.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First of all, I should give a little relevant background information about myself -
      before I started my current degree course in cognitive psychology, I studied <span
        class="explainq1 explain">English literature</span> and, as you can imagine, this meant I spent a great deal of
      time thinking about the notion of creativity and what makes people develop into successful writers. However, the
      idea for this research project came from a very specific source - I became fascinated with the idea of what makes
      an expert creative writer when I read a well-known twentieth century writer’s <span
        class="explainq2 explain">autobiography</span>. I won’t say which one, at this stage, because I think that might
      prejudice your interpretation! Anyway, this got me thinking about the different routes to expertise. Specifically
      I wondered why some people become experts at things whilst others fail to do so, in spite of the fact that they
      may be equally gifted and work equally hard.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I started to read about how other researchers had explored similar questions in
      other fields. I began to see a pattern - that those studies which involved research in a <span
        class="explainq3 explain">lab</span> were too controlled for my purposes and I decided to avoid reading them. I
      was quite surprised to find that the clearest guidance for my topic came from investigations into what I call
      ‘<span class="explainq4 explain">practical skills</span>’ such as hairdressing or waiting tables. Most of these
      studies tended to use a similar set of procedures, which I eventually adopted for my own project.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ll now
      explain what these procedures were. I decided to compare what inexperienced</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">writers do with what experienced writers do. In order to investigate this, I looked
      for four people whom I regarded as real <span class="explainq5 explain">novices</span> in this field - which
      proved easy ... perhaps unsurprisingly. It proved much harder to locate people with suitably extensive experience
      who were willing to take part in my study. I asked the first four to do a set writing task and as they wrote, to
      talk into a tape-recorder ... a technique known as ‘think aloud’ ... this was in order to get <span
        class="explainq6 explain">experimental</span> data. Whilst they were doing this, a research assistant recorded
      them using <span class="explainq7 explain">video</span> - I thought it might be helpful for me in my
      transcriptions later on. I then asked four experienced writers to do exactly the same task. After this, I made a
      comparison between the two sets of data and this helped me to produce a <span
        class="explainq8 explain">framework</span> for analysis. In particular, I identified five major stages which all
      creative writers seem to go through when generating this genre of text. I think it was fairly effective but still
      needs some work ... so I intend to tighten this up later for use with subsequent data sets.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I then wanted to see whether experienced writers were actually producing the better
      pieces of writing. So I asked an <span class="explainq9 explain">editor</span>, an expert in reviewing creative
      writing, to decide which were the best pieces of writing. This person put the eight pieces of work in order of
      quality - in rank order - and, using his evaluations, I was then able to work out which <span
        class="explainq10 explain">sequence</span> of the five stages seemed to lead to the best quality writing.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now my findings are by no means conclusive as this point ... I still have a long
      way to go but if any of you have any questions, I’d be happy to answer them and ...</span></p>
