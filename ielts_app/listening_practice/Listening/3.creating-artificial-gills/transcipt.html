    <p>In my talk today I’ll be exploring the idea of artificial gills. I’ll start by introducing the
        concept,&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">giving some background and so forth and then I’ll go on to explain
            the technological applications, including a short, very simple, experiment I conducted.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting with the background ... As everyone knows, all living creatures need
            oxygen to live. Mammals take in oxygen from the atmosphere by using their lungs, and fishes take oxygen from
            water by means of their gills, which of course in most fishes are located either side of their head.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But human beings have always dreamt of being able to swim underwater like the
            fishes, breathing without the help of oxygen tanks. I don’t know whether any of you have done any scuba
            diving but it’s a real pain having to use all that equipment. You need special training, and it’s generally
            agreed that tanks are too <span class="explainq1 explain">heavy</span> and big to enable most people to move
            and work comfortably underwater. So scientists are trying a different tack: rather than humans carrying an
            oxygen supply as they go underwater, wouldn’t it possible to extract oxygen in situ, that is, directly from
            the water, whilst swimming?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the nineteen sixties the famous underwater explorer Jacques Cousteau, for
            example, predicted that one day <span class="explainq2 explain">surgery</span> could be used to equip humans
            with gills. He believed our lungs could be bypassed and we would learn to live underwater just as naturally
            as we live on land. But of course, most of us would prefer not to go to such extremes.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been looking at some fairly simple technologies developed to extract oxygen
            from water - ways to produce a simple, practical artificial gill enabling humans to live and breathe in
            water without harm. Now, how scientists and inventors went about this was to look at the way different
            animals handled this - fairly obviously they looked at the way fishes breathe but also how they move down
            and float up to the surface using inflatable sacs, called swim bladders. Scientists also looked at animals
            without gills, which use bubbles of air underwater, <strong>notably</strong> <span
                class="explainq3 explain">beetles</span>. These insects contrive to stay underwater for long periods by
            breathing from this bubble which they hold under their wing cases.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By looking at these animal adaptations, inventors began to come up with their own
            ‘artificial&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gills’. Now making a crude gill is actually rather
            easy - more straightforward than you would think. You take a watertight box ... which is made of a material
            which is permeable to <span class="explainq4 explain">gas</span>, that is, it allows it to <strong>pass
                through,</strong> inwards and outwards. You then fill this with air, fix it to the diver’s face and go
            down underwater. But a crucial factor is that the diver has to keep the water <span
                class="explainq5 explain">moving</span>, so that water high in oxygen is always in contact with the
            gill, so he can’t really stay still. And to maximise this contact it’s necessary for your gill to have a big
            <span class="explainq6 explain">surface area</span>. Different gill designers have addressed this problem in
            different ways but many choose to use a network or lattice-arrangement of <strong>tiny</strong> <span
                class="explainq7 explain">tubes</span> as part of their artificial gills. Then the diver is able to
            breathe in and out - oxygen from the water passes through the outer walls of the gill and carbon-dioxide is
            expelled. In a nut-shell, that’s how the artificial gill works.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, having read about these simple gill mechanisms, I decided to create my own. I
            followed the procedure I’ve just described and it worked pretty well when I tried it out in the swimming
            pool ... I lasted underwater for nearly forty minutes! However, I’ve read about other people breathing
            through their gill for several hours.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the basic idea works well, but the real limitation is that these simple gills
            don’t work as the diver descends to any great depth because the <span
                class="explainq8 explain">pressure</span> builds and a whole different set of problems are caused by
            that ... Research is being done into how these problems might be overcome . but that’s another story which
            has to be the subject of another talk!</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite this serious limitation, many people have high hopes for the artificial
            gill and they think it might have applications beyond simply enabling an individual to stay underwater for a
            length of time. For example, the same technology might be used to provide oxygen for <span
                class="explainq9 explain">submarines</span> ... enabling them to stay submerged for months on end
            without resorting to potentially dangerous technologies such as nuclear power. Another idea is to use oxygen
            derived from the water as energy for <span class="explainq10 explain">fuel</span> cells. These could power
            machinery underwater, such as robotic devices ...</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, in my view, this is an area of technology with great potential. Now, if
            anyone has any questions, I’d be happy to answer ...</span></p>
