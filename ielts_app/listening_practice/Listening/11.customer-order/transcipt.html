  <p><strong>Woman: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Gina speaking. How can I help you?</p>
  <p><strong>Man: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Oh, hello - I'd like to order some stationery, please.</p>
  <p><strong>Woman: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>And who am I speaking to?</p>
  <p><strong>Man: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> John Carter.</p>
  <p><strong>Woman: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Right - can I just confirm your account number and the name of your
    company, John?</p>
  <p><strong>Man: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Sure! The account number is <span class="explainq1 explain">6 9 2 4 double
      1 </span></p>
  <p><strong>Woman: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Six nine two four one one. Right, and you're from 'Rainbow Computers?'
  </p>
  <p><strong>Man: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> No. The company is <span class="explainq2 explain">Rainbow
      Communications</span></p>
  <p><strong>Woman: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Oh, OK, I'll just fix that on the system ... communications. And what
    would you like to order, John?</p>
  <p><strong>Man: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Envelopes. We need a box of A4 - that is, normal size envelopes</p>
  <p><strong>Woman: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>White, yellow or vanilla?</p>
  <p><strong>Man: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> <span class="explainq3 explain">We'll have the plain white please</span> -
    but the ones with the little windows</p>
  <p><strong>Woman: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>OK ... One box - A4 - white - just the one box, was it?</p>
  <p><strong>Man: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> <span class="explainq4 explain">Urn, on second thoughts make that two
      boxes</span>. We go through heaps of envelopes. As a matter of interest.&nbsp;Are they made from recycled paper?
  </p>
  <p><strong>Woman: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>No. You can't get white recycled paper. The recycled ones are grey and
    they're more expensive actually.</p>
  <p><strong>Man: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Right - we'll stick to white then.</p>
  <p><strong>Woman: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Something else, John?</p>
  <p><strong>Man: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Yes, we need some coloured photocopy paper. What colours do you have?</p>
  <p><strong>Woman: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>We've got purple, light blue, blue, light green - whatever you want,
    pretty much. There are 500 sheets to the pack.</p>
  <p><strong>Man: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Let's see ... <span class="explainq5 explain">we're going to need a lot of
      blue paper</span> for our new price lists so can you give us ten packs, please. Make sure it's the light blue
    though ...</p>
  <p><strong>Woman: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><span class="explainq6 explain">Ten packs of the light blue</span>.
    Anything else that we can help you with?</p>
  <p><strong>Man: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Let me think ... what else do we need? I'm sure there was something else.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Woman: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Pens, paper clips, fax paper, computer supplies, office furniture?</p>
  <p><strong>Man: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Oh, yes! <span class="explainq7 explain">We need floppy disks</span> - do
    you have those nice coloured ones?</p>
  <p><strong>Woman: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Yes, but they're a bit more expensive than the black ones.</p>
  <p><strong>Man: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> That's alright. I'm not paying, anyway!</p>
  <p><strong>Woman: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Right. Floppy disks. And what about diaries for next year? We've got them
    in stock already and it's a good idea to order early.</p>
  <p><strong>Man: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> No - I think we're alright for diaries but something we do need is <span
      class="explainq8 explain">one of those big wall calendars</span> - you know, one that shows the whole year at a
    glance. Do you stock those?</p>
  <p><strong>Woman: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>We certainly do.</p>
  <p><strong>Man: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> OK - can you include a wall calendar then, with the other stuff. Just make
    sure it's got the whole year on the one side.</p>
  <p><strong>Woman: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Sure - and do you have a copy of our <span class="explainq9 explain">new
      catalogue</span>?</p>
  <p><strong>Man: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> No, I don't, but could you send one.</p>
  <p><strong>Woman: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Yes! I'll pop one in with the order. You'll find it a lot easier to
    remember what you need if you have our catalogue in front of you next time.</p>
  <p><strong>Man: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Yes, good idea. And when can you deliver this?</p>
  <p><strong>Woman: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Should be with you tomorrow morning.</p>
  <p><strong>Man: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Can you make sure that it's <span class="explainq10 explain">not after
      11.30am</span> because I have to go out at 12 there's only myself here on Fridays.</p>
  <p><strong>Woman: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Fine - I'll make a note on the delivery docket that they should deliver
    before half past eleven. Thanks very much.</p>
  <p>Man: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
