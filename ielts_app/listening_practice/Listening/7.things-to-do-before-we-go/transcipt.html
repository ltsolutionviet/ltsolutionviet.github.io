    <h2>Things to do before we go</h2>

  <p>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our plane tickets arrived this morning ... it reminded me how much there is
      to do before we go.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s write everything down shall we, so we don’t forget anything .</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes. Last time we went away we almost forgot to collect our currency from the bank.
      So let’s start with that.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good thinking. And wasn’t there an appointment you said you’d got to cancel?</span>
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, the <span class="explainq1 explain">hairdresser</span> ... Thanks for
      reminding me. Can you write that down too? The shop will be closed now, but I’ll do it first thing on
      Monday.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OK ... Then, starting on Tuesday we’ve got to take the <span
        class="explainq2 explain">tablets</span> we got from the pharmacy. We really mustn’t forget to do that, we’re
      not protected against malaria till we’ve been taking them for at least seven days.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, so that’s really important.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And what about shopping? There’s still a few things we’ve got to buy the next time
      we’re in town. We need some more sun block don’t we? We’ve only got that factor ten stuff - it won’t be strong
      enough.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve already bought that. But what we do still need to get is <span
        class="explainq3 explain">sunglasses</span>. The ones I’ve got aren’t good enough, and I don’t think yours are
      either.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OK ... I’ve noted that down. And I think I’m going to get another bag too. Just a
      small one. We always seem to come back with more things than we take!</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shall we get an extra <span class="explainq4 explain">lock</span> for our suitcase
      as well? </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just in case the one we’ve got breaks. They don’t seem to last long.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, they are a bit flimsy. OK ... Right ... Oh yes, and we need an <span
        class="explainq5 explain">adaptor</span> for our electrical things. Your hair dryer and my shaver ... The plugs
      on them are bound to be the wrong type.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We could get one at the airport. They always have them there.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well I’d rather get it beforehand, so I’m writing it down. And then I think that’s
      it isn’t it?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think so. As far as shopping’s concerned. But we also need to order a <span
        class="explainq6 explain">taxi</span> to take us to the airport. We should do that well in advance. My sister
      left it too late and she had to take the train - with that huge suitcase of hers!</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know, she really struggled with it ...</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now let’s see ... Your mother said she’d come in regularly while we’re away, so
      what do we want her to do? I’ll write some instructions and we can give them to her tomorrow. Good idea. Well ...
      the cat’s the main thing.</span></p>
  <p>Feed ... the cat ...</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We ought to leave her the vet’s details as well, just in case there’s a
      problem.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes. Have you got them handy?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hang on, I’m just looking ... Yes. His name’s Colin <span
        class="explainq7 explain">Jefferey</span>.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is that spelt with a G?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually it’s J-E-double F-E-R-E-Y. Quite an unusual spelling, isn’t it?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mmm. And his number?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span class="explainq8 explain">Oh treble seven, five nine four ... one two
        eight</span>. It’s a mobile.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OK.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And you should write down where it is - it’s Fore Street, not sure what number, but
      it’s next to the bus stop isn’t it?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s not a very good landmark, but it’s on the other side of the road to the
      <span class="explainq9 explain">church</span>, so I’ll tell her that. Let’s hope she won’t need a vet
      anyway!</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes. Right, apart from that there are the plants to water. Ask her to make sure
      they don’t dry out.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh yes, and I’ve already mentioned the problem with the boiler, and your mum said
      she’d come round to meet the heating engineer and let him in.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes. It’s a lot for her to do, but we really need to get the problem sorted out,
      and the earliest date I could get an appointment was <span class="explainq10 explain">April the
        thirtieth</span>.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isn’t it the day after we go?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes - we leave on the twenty-ninth. And she’ll have to hang around till the job’s
      finished. Oh well, she won’t mind I’m sure. She likes helping people out.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, she does.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OK ... That’s it then I think. Unless you can think of anything else?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not at the moment. Leave the list there and I’ll ...</span></p>
