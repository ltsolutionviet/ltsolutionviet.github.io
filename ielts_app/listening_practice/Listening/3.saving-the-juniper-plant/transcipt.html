    <h2>Saving the juniper plant</h2>
    <img src="saving-the-juniper-plant.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="max-width: 400px; margin: auto;">
  </div>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For my presentation, I’m going to summarise what I’ve found out about efforts to
      save one&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">plant species ... the juniper bush. It once flourished in
      Britain and throughout the world’s temperate zones, but over the last few decades has declined considerably.
      Before I go on to explain the steps being taken to save it in England, let me start by looking at some background
      information and why the juniper has been so important in cultural as well as ecological terms, historically and in
      the present day.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firstly, I want to emphasise the fact that <strong>juniper</strong> is a
      <strong>very ancient plant</strong>. It has been discovered that it was actually amongst the <strong>first species
        of plants</strong> to establish itself in Britain in the period following the <strong>most recent</strong> <span
        class="explainq1 explain">Ice Age</span>. And, as I say, it has a much valued place in British culture. It was
      used widely as a <strong>fuel</strong> during the Middle Ages because, when burnt, the <strong>smoke</strong>
      given off is all but <span class="explainq2 explain">invisible</span> and so any <strong>illicit</strong>
      activities involving fire could go on without being detected, for example, cooking game hunted illegally. It also
      has valuable medicinal properties. Particularly during large epidemics, <strong>oils</strong> were
      <strong>extracted</strong> from the juniper wood and sprayed in the air to try to prevent the
      <strong>spread</strong> of <span class="explainq3 explain">infection</span> in hospital wards. And these days,
      perhaps its most well known use is in cuisine...cooking, where its <strong>berries</strong> are a much-valued
      ingredient, used to <span class="explainq4 explain">flavour</span> a variety of <strong>meat</strong>
      <strong>dishes</strong> and also <strong>drinks</strong>.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turning now to ecological issues, juniper bushes play an important role in
      supporting other living things. If juniper bushes are wiped out, this would <strong>radically</strong> affect many
      different insect and also <span class="explainq5 explain">fungus</span> species. We simply cannot afford to let
      this species die out.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, why is the juniper plant declining at such a rapid rate? Well a survey
      conducted in the north and west of Britain in two thousand and four to five showed that a major problem is the
      fact that in present-day populations, <strong>ratios</strong> between the <span
        class="explainq6 explain">sexes</span> are <strong>unbalanced</strong> and without a proper mix of male and
      female, bushes don’t get <strong>pollinated</strong>. Also, the survey found that in a lot of these populations,
      the plants are the same age, so this means that bushes grow old and start to die at similar times ... leading to
      swift <span class="explainq7 explain">extinction</span> of <strong>whole populations</strong>.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, the charity Plantlife is trying to do something to halt the decline in juniper
      species. It’s currently trying out two new major <strong>salvage</strong> techniques, this time focusing on <span
        class="explainq8 explain">lowland</span> regions of England. The first thing it’s trying is to provide <span
        class="explainq9 explain">shelters</span> for the <strong>seedlings</strong> in areas where juniper populations
      are fairly well established. These, of course, are designed to help protect the plants at their most vulnerable
      stage. A further measure is that in areas where colonies have all but died out, numbers are being
      <strong>bolstered</strong> by the planting of <span class="explainq10 explain">cuttings</span> which have been
      taken from healthy bushes elsewhere.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, I hope I’ve given a clear picture of the problems facing this culturally and
      ecologically valuable plant and of the measures being taken by Plantlife to <strong>tackle</strong> them. If
      anyone has any questions, I’d be happy to ...</span></p>
