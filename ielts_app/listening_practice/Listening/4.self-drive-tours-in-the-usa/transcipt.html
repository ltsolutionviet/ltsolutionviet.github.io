  <p>Good morning. World Tours. My name is Jamie. How can I help you?</p>
  <p>Good morning. I want some information on self-drive tours in the USA.<br>Could you send me a brochure?</p>
  <p>Of course. Could I have your name please?</p>
  <p>Andrea Brown.</p>
  <p>Thank you. And your address?</p>
  <p>24. <span class="explainq1 explain">Ardleigh</span> Road.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Can you spell that?</p>
  <p>A-R-D-L-E-l-G-H Road.</p>
  <p>Postcode?</p>
  <p>BH520P</p>
  <p>Thanks. And can I have your phone number?</p>
  <p>Is a mobile alright?</p>
  <p>Fine.</p>
  <p>It's 07786643091.</p>
  <p>Thank you. And can I ask you where you heard about World Tours? From a friend? Or did you see an advert somewhere?
  </p>
  <p>No. I read about you in the <span class="explainq2 explain">newspaper</span>.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>OK, I'll get the brochures in the post to you but can I give you some information over the phone. What kinds of
    things do you want to do on your holiday?</p>
  <p>I’m interested in going to California with my family. I’ve got two children and we want to hire a car.</p>
  <p>OK. We have a couple of self-drive tours there visiting different places of interest in California. The first one
    begins in Los Angeles and there's plenty of time to visit some of the <span class="explainq3 explain">theme</span>
    parks there.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>That’s something on my children’s list so I'd want to include that.</p>
  <p>Good. Then you drive to San Francisco. From San Francisco you can drive to Yosemite Park where you spend a couple
    of nights. You can choose to stay in a lodge or on the campsite.</p>
  <p>I don't like the idea of staying in a <span class="explainq4 explain">tent</span>. It'd be too hot.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Right. And the tour ends in Las Vegas.</p>
  <p>OK.</p>
  <p>The other trip we can arrange is slightly different. It starts in San Francisco. Then you drive south to Cambria.
  </p>
  <p>Someone told me there’s a really&nbsp;nice <span class="explainq5 explain">castle</span> near Cambria. Will we go
    near that?&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Hearst Castle is on that road so you could stop there.</p>
  <p>Good. I'd like to do that. Does this trip also go into the desert?</p>
  <p>No, it continues to Santa Monica where most people like to stop and do some shopping.</p>
  <p>We have enough of that at home so that doesn’t interest us.</p>
  <p>Well you could go straight on to San Diego.</p>
  <p>That's good for <span class="explainq6 explain">beaches</span> isn’t it?&nbsp;</p>
  <p>That’s right, that's a good place to relax and your children might like to visit the zoo before flying home.</p>
  <p>I don’t think so. We want some time for sunbathing and swimming.</p>
  <p>So how many days are the trips and how much do they cost?</p>
  <p>The first one I told you about is a self-drive tour through California which lasts twelve days and covers <span
      class="explainq7 explain">2.020</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;kilometres. The shortest journey is 206 km and the longest is
    632 kilometres. The cost is £525 per person.</p>
  <p>That includes accommodation, car rental and a <span class="explainq8 explain">flight</span> but no meals.
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>And the other trip?</p>
  <p>That lasts nine days but you spend only three days on the road. You cover about 980 kilometres altogether.</p>
  <p>So is that cheaper then?</p>
  <p>Yes, it's almost a hundred pounds cheaper. It’s £<span class="explainq9 explain">429</span> per person, which is
    &nbsp;a good deal.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So that covers accommodation and car hire. What about flights?</p>
  <p>They aren’t included. But these hotels offer <span class="explainq10 explain">dinner</span> in the price.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Well, thank you very much. I'll be in touch when I’ve had a chance to look at the brochure.</p>
  <p>I’m pleased to help. Goodbye.</p>
