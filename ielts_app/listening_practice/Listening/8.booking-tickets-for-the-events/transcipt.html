    <p>ROB:</p>
    <p>Good morning. Stretton Festival box office. How can I help you?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>MELANIE:</p>
    <p>Oh, hello. My family and I are on holiday in the area, and we’ve seen some posters about the festival this week.
        Could you tell me about some of the events, please?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROB:</p>
    <p>Of course.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>MELANIE:</p>
    <p>First of all, are there still tickets available for the jazz band on Saturday?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROB:</p>
    <p>There are, but only £<span class="explainqExample explain explainqe">15</span>. The £12 seats have all been sold.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>MELANIE:</p>
    <p>OK. And the venue is the school, isn't it?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROB:</p>
    <p>Yes. that’s right, the <span class="explainq1 explain">secondary</span> school. Make sure you don’t go to the
        primary school by mistake! And there’s an additional performer who isn't mentioned on the posters&nbsp;- Carolyn
        Hart is going to play with the band.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>MELANIE:</p>
    <p>Oh, I think I’ve heard her on the radio. Doesn’t she play the oboe, or flute or something?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROB:</p>
    <p>Yes. the <span class="explainq2 explain">flute</span>. She usually plays with symphony orchestras, and apparently
        this is her first time with a jazz band.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>MELANIE:</p>
    <p>Well, I’d certainly like to hear her. Then the next thing I want to ask about is the duck races - I saw a poster
        beside a river. What are they, exactly?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROB:</p>
    <p>Well, you buy a yellow plastic duck - or as many as you like - they’re a pound each. And you write your name on
        each one. There’ll be several races, depending on the&nbsp;number of ducks taking part. And John Stevens, a
        champion swimmer who lives</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>locally is going to start the races. All the ducks will be launched into the river at the back of the <span
            class="explainq3 explain">cinema</span>, then they’ll float along the river for 500 metres, as far as
        the&nbsp;railway bridge.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>MELANIE:</p>
    <p>And are there any prizes?&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROB:</p>
    <p>Yes, the first duck in each race to arrive at the finishing line wins its owner free tickets for the <span
            class="explainq4 explain">concert</span> on the last night&nbsp;of the festival.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>MELANIE:</p>
    <p>You said you can buy a duck? I’m sure my children will both want one.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROB:</p>
    <p>they’re on sale at a stall in the <span class="explainq5 explain">market</span>. You can’t miss it - it’s got an
        enormous sign showing a couple of ducks.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>MELANIE:</p>
    <p>OK. I’ll go there this afternoon. I remember walking past there yesterday. Now could you tell me something about
        the flower show, please?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROB:</p>
    <p>Well, admission is free, and the show is being held in <span class="explainq6 explain">Bythwaite</span> Hall.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>MELANIE:</p>
    <p>Sorry, how do you spell that?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROB:</p>
    <p>B-Y-T-H-W-A-l-T-E. Bythwaite.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>MELANIE:</p>
    <p>Is it easy to find? I’m not very familiar with the town yet.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROB:</p>
    <p>Oh, you won’t have any problem. It’s right in the centre of Stretton. It’s the only old building in the town, so
        it’s easy to recognise.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>MELANIE:</p>
    <p>I know it. I presume it’s open all day.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROB:</p>
    <p>Yes, but if you’d like to see the prizes being awarded for the best flowers, you’ll need to be there at 5
        o’clock. The prizes are being given by a famous <span class="explainq7 explain">actor</span>,
        Kevin&nbsp;Shapless. He lives nearby and gets involved in a lot of community events.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>MELANIE:</p>
    <p>Gosh, I’ve seen him on TV. I’ll definitely go to the prize-giving.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROB:</p>
    <p>Right.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>MELANIE:</p>
    <p>I’ve seen a list of plays that are being performed this week, and I’d like to know which are suitable for my
        children, and which ones my husband and I might go to.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROB:</p>
    <p>How old are your children?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>MELANIE:</p>
    <p>Five and seven. What about '<span class="explainq8 explain">The Mystery of Muldoon</span>’?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROB:</p>
    <p>MELANIE:</p>
    <p>That’s aimed at five to ten-year-olds.</p>
    <p>So if I take my children, I can expect them to enjoy it more than I do?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROB:</p>
    <p>I think so. <span class="explainq9 explain">If you’d like something for yourself and your husband, and leave your
            children with a babysitter. you might like to see ‘Fire and Flood’ </span>- it’s about events&nbsp;that
        really happened in Stretton two hundred years ago, and children might find it&nbsp;rather frightening.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>MELANIE:</p>
    <p>Oh, thanks for the warning. And finally, what about ‘<span class="explainq10 explain">Silly Sailor</span>’?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROB:</p>
    <p>That’s a comedy, and it’s for young and old. In fact, it won an award in the Stretton Drama Festival a couple of
        months ago.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>MELANIE:</p>
    <p>OK. Well, goodbye, and thanks for all the information. I’m looking forward to the festival!</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ROB:</p>
    <p>Goodbye.&nbsp;</p>
