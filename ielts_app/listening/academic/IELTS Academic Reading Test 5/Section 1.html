            </p>
            <p><strong>(A) </strong><span itemprop="body">After 36 days of battling sharks that kept biting   their equipment, scientists have returned from the remote Pacific Ocean with a new way of looking at the world’s largest - and possibly most   mysterious - volcano, Tamu Massif.</span><br>
            </p>
            <noindex>
                <p><strong>(B) </strong><span itemprop="body">The team has begun making 3-D maps that offer the   clearest look yet at the underwater mountain, which covers an area the   size of New Mexico. In the coming months, the maps will be refined and   the data analyzed, with the ultimate goal of figuring out how the   mountain was formed.</span><br>
                </p>
                <p><strong>(C) </strong><span itemprop="body">It's possible that the western edge of Tamu Massif is actually a separate mountain that formed at a different time, says William Sager,   a geologist at the University of Houston who led the expedition. That   would explain some differences between the western part of the mountain   and the main body. </span><br>
                </p>
                <p><strong>(D)</strong>

                    The team also found that the massif (as such a massive mountain is known) is
                    highly pockmarked with craters and cliffs.

                    Magnetic analysis provides some insight into the mountain’s genesis, suggesting
                    that part of it formed through steady releases of lava along the intersection of
                    three mid-ocean ridges, while part of it is harder to explain. A working theory
                    is that a large plume of hot mantle rock may have contributed additional heat
                    and material, a fairly novel idea.<br>
                </p>
                <p><strong>(E)</strong>

                    Tamu Massif lies about 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) east of Japan. It is a
                    rounded dome, or shield volcano, measuring 280 by 400 miles (450 by 650
                    kilometers). Its top lies more than a mile (about 2,000 meters) below the ocean
                    surface and is 50 times larger than the biggest active volcano on Earth,
                    Hawaii’s Mauna Loa.

                    Sager published a paper in 2013 that said the main rise of Tamu Massif is most
                    likely a single volcano, instead of a complex of multiple volcanoes that smashed
                    together. But he couldn’t explain how something so big formed. <br>
                </p>
                <p><strong>(F)</strong><span itemprop="body"> The team used sonar and magnetometers (which   measure magnetic fields) to map more than a million square kilometers of   the ocean floor in great detail. Sager and students teamed up with   Masao Nakanishi of Japan’s Chiba University, with Sager receiving   funding support from the National Geographic Society and the Schmidt   Ocean Institute.</span><br>
                </p>
                <p><strong>(G)</strong>

                    Since sharks are attracted to magnetic fields, the toothy fish “were all over
                    our magnetometer, and it got pretty chomped up,” says Sager. When the team
                    replaced the device with a spare, that unit was nearly ripped off by more
                    sharks.

                    The magnetic field research suggests the mountain formed relatively quickly,
                    sometime around 145 million years ago. Part of the volcano sports magnetic
                    "stripes," or bands with different magnetic properties, suggesting that lava
                    flowed out evenly from the mid-ocean ridges over time and changed in polarity
                    each time Earth's magnetic field reversed direction. The central part of the
                    peak is more jumbled, so it may have formed more quickly or through a different
                    process. <br>
                </p>
                <p><strong>(H)</strong>

                    Sager isn’t sure what caused the magnetic anomalies yet, but suspects more
                    complex forces were at work than simply eruptions from the ridges. It’s possible
                    a deep plume of hot rock from the mantle also contributed to the volcano’s
                    formation, he says.

                    Sager hopes the analysis will also help explain about a dozen other similar
                    features on the ocean floor, as well as add to the overall understanding of
                    plate tectonics.</p></noindex>
