            <p align="center"><strong>Why are Americans so angry?</strong></p>
            <p>Americans are generally known for having a positive outlook on life, but with the
                countdown for November's presidential election now well under way, polls show voters
                are angry. This may explain the success of non-mainstream candidates such as
                Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Bernie Sanders. But what is fuelling the
                frustration? <br>
            </p>
            <noindex>
                <p>A CNN/ORC poll carried out in December 2015 suggests 69% of Americans are either
                    "very angry" or "somewhat angry" about "the way things are going" in the US.

                    And the same proportion - 69% - are angry because the political system "seems to
                    only be working for the insiders with money and power, like those on Wall Street
                    or in Washington," according to a NBC/Wall Street Journal poll from November.

                    Many people are not only angry, they are angrier than they were a year ago,
                    according to an NBC/Esquire survey last month - particularly Republicans (61%),
                    somewhat white people (54%), but also 42% of Democrats, 43% of Latinos and 33%
                    of African Americans.<br>
                </p>
                <p>Candidates have sensed the mood and are adopting the rhetoric. Donald Trump, who
                    has arguably tapped into voters' frustration better than any other candidate,
                    says he is "very, very angry" and will "gladly accept the mantle of anger" while
                    rival Republican Ben Carson says he has encountered "many Americans who are
                    discouraged and angry as they watch the American dream slipping away".

                    Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders says: "I am angry and millions of
                    Americans are angry," while Hillary Clinton says she "understands why people get
                    angry".

                    Here are five reasons why some voters feel the American dream is in tatters.</p>
                <p><strong>1. Economy</strong> <br>
                </p>
                <p>"The failure of the economy to deliver real progress to middle-class and
                    working-class Americans over the past 15 years is the most fundamental source of
                    public anger and disaffection in the US," says William Galston, an expert in
                    governance studies at the Brookings Institution think tank.

                    Although the country may have recovered from the recession - economic output has
                    rebounded and unemployment rates have fallen from 10% in 2009 to 5% in 2015 -
                    Americans are still feeling the pinch in their wallets. Household incomes have,
                    generally speaking, been stagnant for 15 years. In 2014, the median household
                    income was $53,657, according to the US Census Bureau - compared with $57,357 in
                    2007 and $57,843 in 1999 (adjusted for inflation).

                    There is also a sense that many jobs are of lower quality and opportunity is
                    dwindling, says Galston. "The search for explanations can very quickly
                    degenerate into the identification of villains in American politics. On the left
                    it is the billionaires, the banks, and Wall Street. On the right it is
                    immigrants, other countries taking advantage of us and the international economy
                    - they are two sides of the same political coin." </p>
                <p><strong>2. Immigration</strong><br>
                </p>
                <p>America's demographics are changing - nearly 59 million immigrants have arrived
                    in the US since 1965, not all of whom entered the country legally. Forty years
                    ago, 84% of the American population was made up of non-Hispanic white people -
                    by last year the figure was 62%, according to Pew Research. It projects this
                    trend will continue, and by 2055 non-Hispanic white people will make up less
                    than half the population. Pew expects them to account for only 46% of the
                    population by 2065. By 2055, more Asians than any other ethnic group are
                    expected to move to US. </p>
                <p>"It's been an era of huge demographic, racial, cultural, religious and
                    generational change," says Paul Taylor, author of The Next America. "While some
                    celebrate these changes, others deplore them. Some older, whiter voters do not
                    recognise the country they grew up in. There is a sense of alien tribes," he
                    says. </p>
                <p>The US currently has 11.3 million illegal immigrants. Migrants often become a
                    target of anger, says Roberto Suro, an immigration expert at the University of
                    Southern California. "There is a displacement of anxiety and they become the
                    face of larger sources of tensions, such as terrorism, jobs and dissatisfaction.
                    We saw that very clearly when Donald Trump switched from [complaining about]
                    Mexicans to Muslims without skipping a beat after San Bernardino," he says,
                    referring to the shooting in California in December that left 14 people
                    dead.</p>
                <p><strong>3. Washington</strong></p>
                <p>"When asked if they trust the government, 89% of Republicans and 72% of Democrats
                    say "only sometimes" or "never", according to Pew Research. Six out of 10
                    Americans think the government has too much power, a survey by Gallup suggests,
                    while the government has been named as the top problem in the US for two years
                    in a row - above issues such as the economy, jobs and immigration, according to
                    the organisation. </p>
                <p>The gridlock on Capitol Hill and the perceived impotence of elected officials has
                    led to resentment among 20 to 30% of voters, says polling expert Karlyn Bowman,
                    from the American Enterprise Institute. "People see politicians fighting and
                    things not getting done - plus the responsibilities of Congress have grown
                    significantly since the 1970s and there is simply more to criticise. People feel
                    more distant from their government and sour on it," she says. </p>
                <p>William Galston thinks part of the appeal of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders is
                    down to frustration with what some see as a failing system. "So on the right you
                    have someone who is running as a 'strong man', a Berlusconi and Putin, who will
                    get things done, and on the left you have someone who is rejecting
                    incrementalism and calling for a political revolution," he says. </p>
                <p>Ted Cruz, who won the Republican caucuses in Iowa, is also running as an
                    anti-establishment candidate. "Tonight is a victory for every American who's
                    watched in dismay as career politicians in Washington in both parties refuse to
                    listen and too often fail to keep their commitments to the people," he said on
                    Monday night.</p>
                <p><strong>4. America's place in the world</strong><br>
                </p>
                <p>America is used to being seen as a superpower but the number of Americans that
                    think the US "stands above all other countries in the world" went from 38% in
                    2012 to 28% in 2014, Pew Research suggests. Seventy percent of Americans also
                    think the US is losing respect internationally, according to a 2013 poll by the
                    centre. </p>
                <p>"For a country that is used to being on top of the world, the last 15 years
                    haven't been great in terms of foreign policy. There's a feeling of having been
                    at war since 9/11 that's never really gone away, a sense America doesn't know
                    what it wants and that things aren't going our way," says Roberto Suro. The rise
                    of China, the failure to defeat the Taliban and the slow progress in the fight
                    against the so-called Islamic State group has contributed to the anxiety. </p>
                <p>Americans are also more afraid of the prospect of terrorist attacks than at any
                    time since 9/11, according to a New York Times/CBS poll. The American reaction
                    to the San Bernardino shooting was different to the French reaction to the Paris
                    attacks, says Galston. "Whereas the French rallied around the government,
                    Americans rallied against it. There is an impression that the US government is
                    failing in its most basic obligation to keep country and people safe."</p>
                <p><strong>5. Divided nation</strong><br>
                </p>
                <p>Democrats and Republicans have become more ideologically polarised than ever. The
                    typical (median), Republican is now more conservative in his or her core social,
                    economic and political views than 94% of Democrats, compared with 70% in 1994,
                    according to Pew Research. The median Democrat, meanwhile, is more liberal than
                    92% of Republicans, up from 64%. </p>
                <p>The study also found that the share of Americans with a highly negative view of
                    the opposing party has doubled, and that the animosity is so deep, many would be
                    unhappy if a close relative married someone of a different political
                    persuasion. </p>
                <p>This polarisation makes reaching common ground on big issues such as immigration,
                    healthcare and gun control more complicated. The deadlock is, in turn, angering
                    another part of the electorate. "Despite this rise in polarisation in America, a
                    large mass in the middle are pragmatic. They aren't totally disengaged, they
                    don't want to see Washington gridlocked, but they roll their eyes at the nature
                    of this discourse," says Paul Taylor. This group includes a lot of young people
                    and tends to eschew party labels. "If they voted," he says, "they could play an
                    important part of the election." </p>
