            <p align="center"><strong>Sponging dolphins</strong></p> 
             <noindex>
            <p><strong>&emsp; (A) </strong>In 1984, researchers spotted dolphins doing  something unusual in Shark Bay, Western Australia. When the animals got hungry,  they ripped a marine basket sponge from the sea floor and fitted it over their  beaks like a person would fit a glove over a hand. The scientists suspected that  as the dolphins foraged for fish, the sponges protected their beaks, or rostra,  from the rocks and broken chunks of coral that litter the sea floor, making  this behavior the first example of tool use in this species. </p>
            <p><br>
              <strong>(B)</strong> The researchers surmised that a long time ago  one ingenious Shark Bay dolphin figured out that by prodding the sediments with  a sponge attached to her beak, she could&nbsp;stir  up these swim bladder-less fish without being hurt. Eventually, such technique  became popular among other dolphins. But why do dolphins go to all of this trouble  when they could simply snag a fish from the open sea? The answer is that the  bottom-dwelling fish are a lot more nutritious. Some species also don't have  swim bladders, gas chambers that help other fish control their buoyancy as they  travel up and down the water column. In the Bahamas, where dolphins are also  known to forage for bottom-dwelling fish, dolphins hunt partly by echolocating  these bladders, which give off a strong acoustic signal. That helps the cetaceans  find prey even when it's buried in sea sand. But bottom-dwelling fish, such as  barred sandperch, which are favored by some Shark Bay dolphins, don't have swim  bladders and so are harder to find with echolocation. The sea floor is not  nearly as soft here as it is in the Bahamas, so if dolphins want to probe for&nbsp;these fish, they risk injuring their  rostra.</p>
            <p><br>
              <strong>(C)</strong> Not every dolphin in Shark Bay hunts with  sponges. "It's primarily done by females," says Janet Mann, a  behavioral ecologist. She believes the female dolphins invented the method  because of the "selective pressures they face while raising a calf as long  as they do," about 4 to 5 years. "These clever dolphins have figured  out a way to target fish that other dolphins cannot," she says, adding  that even the local fishermen do not catch, or even know about, this particular  species. Mann's previous research has shown that&nbsp;dolphin mothers pass the sponging method to their daughters and some of  their sons, rare evidence of a cultural tradition in an animal other  than humans. The team has documented three generations of sponging dolphins.</p>
            <p><br>
              <strong>(D)</strong> The foraging technique came to  light a few decades ago - very recently in evolutionary terms - when a local  fisherman spotted what looked like a strange tumour on a dolphin’s nose.  Researchers eventually worked out that the ‘tumour’ was a conically shaped  sponge and it became apparent that the dolphins would spend considerable time  searching for one the right shape to fit their nose. The sponge is used to  scatter the sand gently on the sea floor and disturb buried fish. When a fish  is spotted, the dolphin drops the sponge and gives chase. "It has been thought that  behaviours which are exclusively learnt from one parent are not very stable.  With our model we could now show that sponging can be a stable behaviour,"  said Dr Anna Kopps, a biologist at the University of New South Wales.</p>
            <p><br>
              <strong>(E)</strong> By modelling the emergence of  "sponger" dolphins in a computer simulation, the team of researchers  could see different scenarios in which the skill could have spread among the  dolphin population over the years. They then compared the results of these  simulations with field data on the genetic relationship between the spongers,  to estimate the role of mothers teaching their offspring in transmitting the skill.  They found that if the likelihood of a sponger's offspring learning the ability  was less than certain, the dolphins that did pick up the technique needed to  gain a survival advantage from the skill, in order for the ability to pass on  to the next generation. The model also allowed them to  attempt to calculate the date that the behaviour was likely to have originated."The  results suggested that sponging was innovated at least 120 to 180 years ago -  it is only a best estimate," said Dr Kopps. Scientists discovered that although  dolphins tried to teach the hunting technique to all their young, it was mainly  female offspring that grasped the concept. Why male offspring rarely acquire  the same skill remains unclear, though the team put forward one possible explanation:  male bottlenose dolphins tend to form close bonds with other males, and such  alliances aren't suited to seabed foraging, since it is a time-consuming,  solitary activity.</p>
            <p><br>
              <strong>(F)</strong> The US scientists say discovering a  new tool is a direct sign of intelligence. “There’s a strong link between  animals with larger brains and tool users. Bottlenose dolphins have a brain  second in size only to humans.” said Janet Mann, a marine biologist who led the  research. “Dolphins are already good at catching fish so they don’t need tools,  but they’ve discovered this sponge makes their job easier. Working out how to  use tools in a creative way like that is a hallmark of intelligence.” Mann admits we still do not  understand dolphins well. “It’s hard to get inside their heads because their  brains are constructed differently and it’s very hard to analyse their  languageTranslate, but they do seem very intelligent,” she said.</p>
            <p><br>
              <strong>(G)</strong> Dolphins are also often seen  engaging in playful behaviour and creating tools to use for entertainment. They  have been observed to blow bubbles which they form into rings to play with.  After creating the bubble ring, a dolphin will use its nose and body to  maintain the shape of the bubble and keep it from floating to the surface. The study provides a "better understanding  of the why and how of sponging" by the Shark Bay dolphins, says Louis  Herman, a cognitive psychologist. The work "adds to previously  documented" examples of "innovation by this highly intelligent  species." Patterson's and Mann's results also "reinforce a  pattern" often seen in other tool-using animals, says Simon Reader, a  behavioral biologist. "Tool use appears to be almost a last option, taken  when other options fail or are unavailable," he says, noting that  woodpecker finches in the Galápagos Islands "turn to tool use only in arid  areas," wielding cactus spines to extract grubs from tree branches. Using  tools takes time and energy, Reader says, and animals tend to rely on them only  when there's a guaranteed payoff, such as turning up a fatty fish that most  other dolphins (and fishermen) know nothing about.</p>
