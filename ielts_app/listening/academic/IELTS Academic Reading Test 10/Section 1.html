            <noindex>

                <p>The “Phi Phi Island Resort” is located in Phi Phi Leh island in Thailand, between
                    the large island of Phuket and the west Strait of Malacca coast of the mainland.
                    Phi Phi consists of six small islands 46km south of Phuket. Fine sandy beaches
                    give way to soaring limestone cliffs to form spectacular scenery. Add crystal
                    clear water, a refreshing lack of roads, plus a laid-back lifestyle, and it's
                    easy to see why Phi Phi is one of southern Thailand's most popular
                    destinations.</p>
                <p>The islands are administratively part of Krabi province. Ko Phi Phi is the
                    largest island of the group, and is the most populated island of the group,
                    although the beaches of the second largest island, Ko Phi Phi Leh are visited by
                    many people as well. The rest of the islands in the group, including Bida Nok,
                    Bida Noi, and Bamboo Island are not much more than large limestone rocks jutting
                    out of the sea. The Islands are reachable by speedboats or Long-tail boats most
                    often from Krabi Town or from various piers in Phuket Province.</p>
                <p>The islands came to worldwide prominence when Ko Phi Phi was used as a location
                    for the 2000 British-American film The Beach. This attracted criticism, with
                    claims that the film company had damaged the island's environment, since the
                    producers bulldozed beach areas and planted palm trees to make it resemble
                    description in the book, an accusation the film's makers contest. An increase in
                    tourism was attributed to the film's release, which resulted in increases in
                    waste on the Islands, and more developments in and around the Phi Phi Don
                    Village. </p>


                <p>Unlike its larger brother Ko Phi Phi, Phi Phi Leh is a virgin island - it is
                    almost untouched by human civilization. Surrounded by sheer limestone walls
                    dotted with caves and passages the island's shallow blue-green lagoons and coral
                    gardens are a snorkeler’s paradise. The island also has two magnificent beaches,
                    Loh Samah and Maya Bay.</p>

                <p>The climate on Phi Phi Leh island is influenced by tropical monsoon winds. There
                    are two seasons: the rainy season from May till December and the hot season from
                    January till April. Average temperature ranges between 17–37 degrees Celsius.
                    Average rainfall per year is about 2,231 millimetres, wettest in July and driest
                    in February. </p>
                <p>The “Phi Phi Island Resort” is an eco-friendly hotel that aims at providing
                    excellent service without hurting the local environment. This dreamy lodging in
                    Thailand is as environmentally friendly as it gets. The building itself is built
                    with natural materials, such as local stone and wood. Moreover, all utilities
                    (such as cutlery, hygiene items, towels, kitchen utensils) are made of
                    bio-degradable materials. </p>
                <p>The pool is created in the local stone quarry, so that the harmony of local
                    landscape was not infringed. Since the water in the pool is replete with natural
                    salts and minerals, there is no need in further disinfection with chlorinated
                    compounds and the pool is absolutely chemical-free.</p>
                <p>The hotel provides soaps, gels and creams, which are all natural and organic.
                    Waste is recycled to the garden via a bio-cycle septic system, and “Phi Phi
                    Island Resort” uses hydro-electricity from a Pelton wheel and solar power. </p>
                <p>The restaurant values locally sourced products. That’s why only locally grown
                    vegetables and fruits along with natural sea products are served. The resort
                    ensures that fishing and croppage don’t contravene the local equilibrium of the
                    island.</p>
                <p>Diving and snorkeling at Phi Phi Leh Island are excellent. Many dive companies
                    offer all-inclusive trips only in this location. And other little secluded
                    islands are accessible from “Phi Phi Island Resort” by long-tail boats. Visitors
                    can take advantage of the free bike rentals, free shuttle service in an electric
                    vehicle and even green spa, with all organic products.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, this beautiful resort combines the seclusion much sought after
                    in Thailand with refinement of a 4.5 star resort. Privacy is certain on 70
                    tranquil acres of swaying coconut palms, fragrant gardens, and a half-mile of
                    sparkling shore overlooking the crystal Andaman Sea. Spacious and secluded
                    bungalows conform comfortably to the natural surroundings, welcoming stunning
                    coastal vistas and cool sea breezes. Stylish furnishings, gracious hospitality
                    and a private 800 metres stretch of pristine white sand beach lapped by the
                    turquoise waters of the Andaman Sea create an idyllic setting for a green and
                    calm holiday.</p>
