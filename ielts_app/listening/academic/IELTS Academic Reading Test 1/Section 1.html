            <p align="center"><strong>Aphantasia: A life without mental images</strong></p>
            <p align="center"><strong>Close your eyes and imagine walking along a sandy beach and
                then gazing over the horizon as the Sun rises. How clear is the image that springs
                to mind?</strong></p>
            <noindex>
                <p>Most people can readily conjure images inside their head - known as their mind's
                    eye. But this year scientists have described a condition, aphantasia, in which
                    some people are unable to visualise mental images. </p>
                <p>Niel Kenmuir, from Lancaster, has always had a blind mind's eye. He knew he was
                    different even in childhood. "My stepfather, when I couldn't sleep, told me to
                    count sheep, and he explained what he meant, I tried to do it and I couldn't,"
                    he says. "I couldn't see any sheep jumping over fences, there was nothing to
                    count."</p>
                <p>Our memories are often tied up in images, think back to a wedding or first day at
                    school. As a result, Niel admits, some aspects of his memory are "terrible", but
                    he is very good at remembering facts. And, like others with aphantasia, he
                    struggles to recognise faces. Yet he does not see aphantasia as a disability,
                    but simply a different way of experiencing life. </p>
                <p style="font-weight:bold;" align="center">Mind's eye blind</p>
                <p>Ironically, Niel now works in a bookshop, although he largely sticks to the
                    non-fiction aisles. His condition begs the question what is going on inside his
                    picture-less mind. I asked him what happens when he tries to picture his
                    fiancee. "This is the hardest thing to describe, what happens in my head when I
                    think about things," he says. "When I think about my fiancee there is no image,
                    but I am definitely thinking about her, I know today she has her hair up at the
                    back, she's brunette. But I'm not describing an image I am looking at, I'm
                    remembering features about her, that's the strangest thing and maybe that is a
                    source of some regret."</p>
                <p>The response from his mates is a very sympathetic: "You're weird." But while Niel
                    is very relaxed about his inability to picture things, it is often a cause of
                    distress for others. One person who took part in a study into aphantasia said he
                    had started to feel "isolated" and "alone" after discovering that other people
                    could see images in their heads. Being unable to reminisce about his mother
                    years after her death led to him being "extremely distraught".</p>
                <p style="font-weight:bold;" align="center">The super-visualiser</p>
                <p>At the other end of the spectrum is children's book illustrator, Lauren Beard,
                    whose work on the Fairytale Hairdresser series will be familiar to many
                    six-year-olds. Her career relies on the vivid images that leap into her mind's
                    eye when she reads text from her author. When I met her in her box-room studio
                    in Manchester, she was working on a dramatic scene in the next book. The text
                    describes a baby perilously climbing onto a chandelier.</p>
                "Straightaway I can visualise this grand glass chandelier in some sort of French
                kind of ballroom, and the little baby just swinging off it and really heavy thick
                curtains," she says. "I think I have a strong imagination, so I can create the world
                and then keep adding to it so it gets sort of bigger and bigger in my mind and the
                characters too they sort of evolve. I couldn't really imagine what it's like to not
                imagine, I think it must be a bit of a shame really."<br>
                <p>Not many people have mental imagery as vibrant as Lauren or as blank as Niel.
                    They are the two extremes of visualisation. Adam Zeman, a professor of cognitive
                    and behavioural neurology, wants to compare the lives and experiences of people
                    with aphantasia and its polar-opposite hyperphantasia. His team, based at the
                    University of Exeter, coined the term aphantasia this year in a study in the
                    journal Cortex. </p>
                <p>Prof Zeman tells the BBC: "People who have contacted us say they are really
                    delighted that this has been recognised and has been given a name, because they
                    have been trying to explain to people for years that there is this oddity that
                    they find hard to convey to others." How we imagine is clearly very subjective -
                    one person's vivid scene could be another's grainy picture. But Prof Zeman is
                    certain that aphantasia is real. People often report being able to dream in
                    pictures, and there have been reported cases of people losing the ability to
                    think in images after a brain injury. </p>
                <p>He is adamant that aphantasia is "not a disorder" and says it may affect up to
                    one in 50 people. But he adds: "I think it makes quite an important difference
                    to their experience of life because many of us spend our lives with imagery
                    hovering somewhere in the mind's eye which we inspect from time to time, it's a
                    variability of human experience." </p>
