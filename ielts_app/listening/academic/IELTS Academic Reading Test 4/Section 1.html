            <p align="center"><strong>The potential to sniff out disease</strong></p>
            <p align="center"><strong>The fact diseases have a smell comes as no surprise - but
                finding someone or something that can detect them at an early stage could hold huge
                potential for medicine.</strong></p>
            <noindex>
                <p>Breath, bodily odours and urine are all amazingly revealing about general health.
                    Even the humble cold can give off an odour, thanks to the thick bacteria-ridden
                    mucus that ends up in the back of the throat. The signs are not apparent to
                    everyone - but some super-smellers are very sensitive to the odours. Joy Milne,
                    for example, noticed her husband's smell had changed shortly before he was
                    diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.</p>
                <p>Humans can detect nearly 10,000 different smells. Formed by chemicals in the air,
                    they are absorbed by little hairs, made of extremely sensitive nerve fibres,
                    hanging from the nose's olfactory receptors. And the human sense of smell is
                    10,000 times more sensitive than the sense of taste. But dogs, as the old joke
                    might have had it, smell even better.</p>
                <p>Their ability to detect four times as many odours as humans makes them a
                    potential early warning system for a range of diseases. Research suggesting
                    dogs' could sniff out cancers, for example, was first published about 10 years
                    ago. And there have been many tales of dogs repeatedly sniffing an area of their
                    owner's body, only for it to turn out to be hiding a tumour.</p>
                <p>What they are smelling are the "volatile molecules" given off by cells when they
                    become cancerous. Some studies suggest dogs can be 93% accurate. Others suggest
                    they can detect very small tumours before clinical tests can. And yet more
                    studies have produced mixed results.</p>
                <p>&nbsp; </p>
                <p align="center"><strong>Does cancer smell?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>At Milton Keynes University Hospital, a small team has recently begun to collect
                    human urine samples to test dogs' ability to detect the smell of prostate
                    cancer. The patients had symptoms such as difficulty urinating or a change in
                    flow, which could turn out to be prostate, bladder or liver cancer.</p>
                <p>Rowena Fletcher, head of research and development at the hospital, says the role
                    of the dogs - which have been trained by Medical Detection Dogs - is to pick out
                    samples that smell of cancer. Further down the line, a clinical test will show
                    if the dogs' diagnosis is correct. She says the potential for using dogs in this
                    way is far-reaching - even if it is not practical to have a dog in every
                    surgery.</p>
                <p>"We hope one day that there could be an electronic machine on every GP's desk
                    which could test a urine sample for diseases by smelling it," she says. "But
                    first we need to pick up the pattern of what the dogs are smelling."</p>
                <p>And that's the key. Dogs can't tell us what their noses are detecting, but
                    scientists believe that different cancers could produce different smells,
                    although some might also be very similar.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p align="center"><strong>Electronic noses</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Lab tests to understand what these highly-trained dogs are smelling could then
                    inform the development of 'electronic noses' to detect the same molecules. These
                    might then give rise to better diagnostic tests in the future. The potential for
                    using smell to test for a wide range of diseases is huge, Ms Fletcher says.</p>
                <p>Bacteria, cancers and chronic diseases could all have their own odour - which may
                    be imperceptible to only the most sensitive humans, but obvious to dogs. It may
                    be possible in the future to use disease odours as the basis for a national
                    screening programme or to test everybody at risk of a certain cancer in a
                    particular age group.</p>
                <p>However, there are fewer than 20 dogs in the UK trained to detect cancer at
                    present. Training more will take more funding and time. On the positive side,
                    all dogs are eligible to be trained provided they are keen on searching and
                    hunting. Whatever their breed or size, it's our four-legged friend's astounding
                    sense of smell which could unlock a whole new way of detecting human
                    diseases.</p></noindex>
