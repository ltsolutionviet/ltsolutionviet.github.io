            <p align="center"><strong>The students’ problem</strong></p>
            <p><strong>(A)</strong> The college and university accommodation crisis in Ireland has
                become ‘so chronic’ that students are being forced to sleep rough, share a bed with
                strangers – or give up on studying altogether.<br></p>
            <noindex>
                <p><strong>(B)</strong> The deputy president of the Union of Students in Ireland,
                    Kevin Donoghue, said the problem has become particularly acute in Dublin. He
                    told the Irish Mirror: “Students are so desperate, they’re not just paying
                    through the nose to share rooms – they’re paying to share a bed with complete
                    strangers. It reached crisis point last year and it’s only getting worse. “We’ve
                    heard of students sleeping rough; on sofas, floors and in their cars and I have
                    to stress there’s no student in the country that hasn’t been touched by this
                    crisis. “Commutes – which would once have been considered ridiculous – are now
                    normal, whether that’s by bus, train or car and those who drive often end up
                    sleeping in their car if they’ve an early start the next morning.”<br></p>
                <p><strong>(C)</strong> Worry is increasing over the problems facing Ireland's
                    200,000 students as the number increases over the next 15 years. With 165,000
                    full-time students in Ireland – and that figure expected to increase to around
                    200,000 within the next 15 years –fears remain that there aren’t enough
                    properties to accommodate current numbers.<br></p>
                <p><strong>(D)</strong> Mr. Donoghue added: “The lack of places to live is actually
                    forcing school-leavers out of college altogether. Either they don’t go in the
                    first place or end up having to drop out because they can’t get a room and
                    commuting is just too expensive, stressful and difficult.”<br>
                </p>
                <p><strong>(E)</strong> Claims have emerged from the country that some students have
                    been forced to sleep in cars, or out on the streets, because of the enormous
                    increases to rent in the capital. Those who have been lucky enough to find a
                    place to live have had to do so ‘blind’ by paying for accommodation, months in
                    advance, they haven’t even seen just so they will have a roof over their head
                    over the coming year.<br>
                </p>
                <p><strong>(F)</strong> According to the Irish Independent, it’s the ‘Google effect’
                    which is to blame. As Google and other blue-chip companies open offices in and
                    around Dublin’s docklands area, which are ‘on the doorstep of the city’,
                    international professionals have been flocking to the area which will boast
                    2,600 more apartments, on 50 acres of undeveloped land, over the next three to
                    10 years.<br>
                </p>
                <p><strong>(G)</strong> Rent in the area soared by 15 per cent last year and a
                    two-bedroom apartment overlooking the Grand Canal costs €2,100 (£1,500) per
                    month to rent. Another two-bedroom apartment at Hanover Dock costs €2,350
                    (almost £1,700) with a three-bedroom penthouse – measuring some 136 square
                    metres – sits at €4,500 (£3,200) per month in rent.<br>
                </p>
                <p><strong>(H)</strong> Ireland’s Higher Education Authority admitted this was the
                    first time they had seen circumstances ‘so extreme’ and the Fianna Fáil party
                    leader, Michael Martin, urged on the Government to intervene. He said: “It is
                    very worrying that all of the progress in opening up access to higher education
                    in the last decade – particularly for the working poor – is being derailed
                    because of an entirely foreseeable accommodation crisis.</p></noindex>
