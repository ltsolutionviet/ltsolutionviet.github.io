            <p align="center" style="font-weight:bold;">Sea monsters are the stuff of legend -
                lurking not just in the depths of the oceans, but also the darker corners of our
                minds. What is it that draws us to these creatures?</p>
            <p>&emsp; "This inhuman place makes human monsters," wrote Stephen King in his novel The
                Shining. Many academics agree that monsters lurk in the deepest recesses, they prowl
                through our ancestral minds appearing in the half-light, under the bed - or at the
                bottom of the sea.</p>
            <noindex>
                <p>&emsp; "They don't really exist, but they play a huge role in our mindscapes, in
                    our dreams, stories, nightmares, myths and so on," says Matthias Classen,
                    assistant professor of literature and media at Aarhus University in Denmark, who
                    studies monsters in literature. "Monsters say something about human psychology,
                    not the world."</p>
                &emsp; One Norse legend talks of the Kraken, a deep sea creature that was the curse
                of fishermen. If sailors found a place with many fish, most likely it was the
                monster that was driving them to the surface. If it saw the ship it would pluck the
                hapless sailors from the boat and drag them to a watery grave. <p></p>
                <p>&emsp; This terrifying legend occupied the mind and pen of the poet Alfred Lord
                    Tennyson too. In his short 1830 poem The Kraken he wrote: "Below the thunders of
                    the upper deep, / Far far beneath in the abysmal sea, / His ancient, dreamless,
                    uninvaded sleep / The Kraken sleepeth."
                </p>
                <p>&emsp; The deeper we travel into the ocean, the deeper we delve into our own
                    psyche. And when we can go no further - there lurks the Kraken. </p>
                <p>&emsp; Most likely the Kraken is based on a real creature - the giant squid. The
                    huge mollusc takes pride of place as the personification of the terrors of the
                    deep sea. Sailors would have encountered it at the surface, dying, and probably
                    thrashing about. It would have made a weird sight, "about the most alien thing
                    you can imagine," says Edith Widder, CEO at the Ocean Research and Conservation
                    Association. </p>
                <p>&emsp; "It has eight lashing arms and two slashing tentacles growing straight out
                    of its head and it's got serrated suckers that can latch on to the slimiest of
                    prey and it's got a parrot beak that can rip flesh. It's got an eye the size of
                    your head, it's got a jet propulsion system and three hearts that pump blue
                    blood."</p>
                <p>&emsp; The giant squid continued to dominate stories of sea monsters with the
                    famous 1870 novel, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, by Jules Verne.
                    Verne's submarine fantasy is a classic story of puny man against a gigantic
                    squid. </p>
                <p>&emsp; The monster needed no embellishment - this creature was scary enough, and
                    Verne incorporated as much fact as possible into the story, says Emily Alder
                    from Edinburgh Napier University. "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea and
                    another contemporaneous book, Victor Hugo's Toilers of the Sea, both tried to
                    represent the giant squid as they might have been actual zoological animals,
                    much more taking the squid as a biological creature than a mythical creature."
                    It was a given that the squid was vicious and would readily attack humans given
                    the chance. </p>

                <p>&emsp; That myth wasn't busted until 2012, when Edith Widder and her colleagues
                    were the first people to successfully film giant squid under water and see
                    first-hand the true character of the monster of the deep. They realised previous
                    attempts to film squid had failed because the bright lights and noisy thrusters
                    on submersibles had frightened them away. </p>
                <p>&emsp; By quietening down the engines and using bioluminescence to attract it,
                    they managed to see this most extraordinary animal in its natural habitat. It
                    serenely glided into view, its body rippled with metallic colours of bronze and
                    silver. Its huge, intelligent eye watched the submarine warily as it delicately
                    picked at the bait with its beak. It was balletic and mesmeric. It could not
                    have been further from the gnashing, human-destroying creature of myth and
                    literature. In reality this is a gentle giant that is easily scared and pecks at
                    its food.</p>

                <p>&emsp; Another giant squid lies peacefully in the Natural History Museum in
                    London, in the Spirit Room, where it is preserved in a huge glass case. In 2004
                    it was caught in a fishing net off the Falkland Islands and died at the surface.
                    The crew immediately froze its body and it was sent to be preserved in the
                    museum by the Curator of Molluscs, Jon Ablett. It is called Archie, an
                    affectionate short version of its Latin name Architeuthis dux. It is the longest
                    preserved specimen of a giant squid in the world.</p>

                <p>&emsp; "It really has brought science to life for many people," says Ablett.
                    "Sometimes I feel a bit overshadowed by Archie, most of my work is on slugs and
                    snails but unfortunately most people don't want to talk about that!"</p>

                <p>&emsp; And so today we can watch Archie's graceful relative on film and stare
                    Archie herself (she is a female) eye-to-eye in a museum. But have we finally
                    slain the monster of the deep? Now we know there is nothing to be afraid of, can
                    the Kraken finally be laid to rest? Probably not says Classen. "We humans are
                    afraid of the strangest things. They don't need to be realistic. There's no
                    indication that enlightenment and scientific progress has banished the monsters
                    from the shadows of our imaginations. We will continue to be afraid of very
                    strange things, including probably sea monsters." </p>
                <p>&emsp; Indeed we are. The Kraken made a fearsome appearance in the blockbuster
                    series Pirates of the Caribbean. It forced Captain Jack Sparrow to face his
                    demons in a terrifying face-to-face encounter. Pirates needed the monstrous
                    Kraken, nothing else would do. Or, as the German film director Werner Herzog put
                    it, "What would an ocean be without a monster lurking in the dark? It would be
                    like sleep without dreams."
