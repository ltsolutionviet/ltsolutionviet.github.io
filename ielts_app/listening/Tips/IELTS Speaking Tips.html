       <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Examiner</span>: Do you do any sport?<br>
       <span style="font-weight:bold">You</span>: No, I don't like sports... <em>[Don't stop there!]</em> I'm not a very active person and I've never liked P.E. in school. But I like playing intellectual games instead. For example, I find chess very interesting.</p></li>

This way you'll have some extra time to plan your answer.</p><p>You can also reformulate the question: </p><p><span style="font-weight:bold">Examiner</span>: What was your favourite book in the childhood?<br><span style="font-weight:bold">You</span>: What book did I like as a child?

       <img src="../images/first-impression.jpg" width="65%" alt="IELTS Speaking tips: make a good first impression">
       <li> <p class="tip">Make a good first impression</p>
      <p> Look good, smell good and feel good. Be confident. Although it may not seem very important, a strong first impression will go a long way. </p></li>
      <li> <p class="tip">Don't learn answers by heart</p> 
      <p>Examiners are able to determine whether you speak freely or you memorized the answer before your interview. Learning full scripts is a bad idea. Instead, it is much better to learn separate words and collocations and adopt them in your speech.</p></li>
