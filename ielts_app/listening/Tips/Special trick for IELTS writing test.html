		<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Usually you get time before the writing test begins after reading test is over. </strong></span></p>
<p>All you have to do is just spend 60 – 120 seconds to write your 25 most important words from your own vocabulary on QUESTION PAPER, remember its QUESTION PAPER, which is separately kept from answer sheet. There is a blank space on each inside pages below the topics and questions.</p>



<p>Write all the words from your own vocabulary there irrespective of whatever be the topic or question. Do this before you even read the topic, as this will speed up the process when you have not yet started thinking on topic in question.</p>
<p>Now take another 5 mins to think on how you will frame your sentences to use maximum number of words from those 25 words. Some of them may be useless depending on the topic in question. That’s not a problem at all.</p>
<p>If possible then write few points you are going to cover in your letter and essay on question paper, this exercise is not a waste of time at all, as you will not waste any time later and neither you will need to erase and write few sentences again which usually everyone does.</p>
<p>This is exactly like spending time in sharpening your blade before cutting the tree and then Cutting is faster than others. Successful people call it planning which ultimately helps later as you already know in which direction you are and you have to move while writing.</p>
<p>Anyhow sparing extra time at last and doing nothing is a mere wastage of time, because in writing what I have felt is there is always a better way and some space for improvements.</p>
<p>Once writing is done even if you know better idea you are helpless as you cannot start all over again, that’s like letting the bands go away in front of you after knowing a better way.</p>
<p>So don’t make the mistake of attacking the answer sheet the very next moment you get it. Spend more time on question paper as it is merely a rough paper provided to you for making any notes or using it as scratch pad. Use it.</p>
<p>This is the magic stick of your own vocabulary of 25 words which you can use in speaking as well. This is probably the shortest and smartest way to prove that you have a strong vocabulary without having one.</p>
<p>This trick works only in exams as there is a limited time to show your performance. But to be successful in your career you slowly need to improve and increase your vocabulary and lexical resource day by day.</p>
<p>This is a gradual and painstaking process, practice being the only solution and no other shortcuts. If you are a lazy fellow like me, I am going to provide you some ready to start list of vocabulary, which will include major words you can use in any topic in any situation.</p>
<p><strong>Here we go!</strong></p>
