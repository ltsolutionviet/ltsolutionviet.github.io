        <h2>Exercise 2</h2>
        
        
        
        <p>Here you will find <strong>IELTS Listening exercise</strong> for <strong>multiple choice questions</strong>. By completing this exercise you will improve your IELTS Listening skills and develop specific techniques for answering multiple choice questions.</p>
        <p>Multiple choice questions usually contain <em>3 answers</em> and <em>only one of them is correct</em>. Your task is to choose the correct answer. Multiple choice questions are common for parts 2, 3 and 4 of IELTS Listening test.  </p>
        <p>To <u>succeed in IELTS Listening multiple choice questions</u> you should:
        </p><ul><li>Be patient. You are likely to hear ALL the given answers, so choosing the one you hear the first is not a good strategy.</li>
        <li>Be attentive - sometimes the speaker can correct himself or give new details.</li>
        <li>Beware of order - the answers will not necessarily be in the same order as the speaker gives information.  </li>
        </ul><p></p>
        <br>
        <p>Now listen to the recording and choose the correct letter, <strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, or<strong> C</strong>.</p>

So choice C is incorrect. Later on, we can hear the narrator says: "Stevenson begin to write "Kidnapped"..." And from the context, it can be understood that B is the right answer.<br> </p> </div>

Then the narrato says: "...With me is Louise...to take us <strong>through a story</strong>..." So the right answer is C.<br> </p> </div>

The answer A says that one is yound and other is old, but experienced doesn't mean old, so both A and C is incorrect.<br> </p> </div>
