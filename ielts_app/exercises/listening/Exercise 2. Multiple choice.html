    <h2>Exercise 2</h2>



    <p>Here you will find <strong>IELTS Listening exercise</strong> for <strong>multiple choice questions</strong>. By
      completing this exercise you will improve your IELTS Listening skills and develop specific techniques for
      answering multiple choice questions.</p>
    <p>Multiple choice questions usually contain <em>3 answers</em> and <em>only one of them is correct</em>. Your task
      is to choose the correct answer. Multiple choice questions are common for parts 2, 3 and 4 of IELTS Listening
      test. </p>
    <p>To <u>succeed in IELTS Listening multiple choice questions</u> you should:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Be patient. You are likely to hear ALL the given answers, so choosing the one you hear the first is not a good
        strategy.</li>
      <li>Be attentive - sometimes the speaker can correct himself or give new details.</li>
      <li>Beware of order - the answers will not necessarily be in the same order as the speaker gives information.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <br>
    <p>Now listen to the recording and choose the correct letter, <strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, or<strong>
        C</strong>.</p>

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <form>
      <ol>
        <li> The narrator choose which of the following books, as his favourite?
          <span id="s1"> </span> &emsp;<button class="b2" id="buttonhint1" type="button" onclick="toggle('hint1')">Show
            hint</button>
          <div id="hint1" style="display:none;">
            <p class="hint"> During the first minute of the recording, we can hear the narrator contemplating his two
              favourite book by Robert Louis Stevenson: <em>Treasure Island</em> and <em>Kidnapped</em>. So choice C is
              incorrect. Later on, we can hear the narrator says: "Stevenson begin to write "Kidnapped"..." And from the
              context, it can be understood that B is the right answer.<br> </p>
          </div>

          <ol type="A">
            <li> <input type="radio" name="q1"> Treasure Island </li>
            <li> <input type="radio" name="q1" id="a1"> Kidnapped </li>
            <li> <input type="radio" name="q1"> A Child's Garden of Verses </li>
          </ol>
        </li> <br>


        <br>
        <li> Louise joined the narrator <strong>primarily</strong> because
          <span id="s2"> </span>
          &emsp;<button class="b2" id="buttonhint2" type="button" onclick="toggle('hint2')">Show hint</button>

          <div id="hint2" style="display:none;">
            <p class="hint"> The narrator describes Louise as a writer and Stevenson's admirer, but it is a description
              of Louise. Then the narrato says: "...With me is Louise...to take us <strong>through a story</strong>..."
              So the right answer is C.<br> </p>
          </div>
          <ol type="A">
            <li> <input type="radio" name="q2"> she was lucky to be selected randomly from a group of readers to join
            </li>
            <li> <input type="radio" name="q2"> she is a writer and likes Robert Louis Stevenson </li>
            <li> <input type="radio" name="q2" id="a2"> she will help to take people through the story of "Kidnapped"
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li> <br>

        <br>
        <li> Louise envies people who have not yet read "Kidnapped" because
          <span id="s3"> </span>
          &emsp;<button class="b2" id="buttonhint3" type="button" onclick="toggle('hint3')">Show hint</button>

          <div id="hint3" style="display:none;">
            <p class="hint"> We can hear Louise say: "I almost envy them [people, who have not read "Kidnapped], because
              they're in for such <strong>an amazing treat</strong>..." This indicates the A is the correct answer. <br>
            </p>
          </div>

          <ol type="A">
            <li> <input type="radio" name="q3" id="a3"> they still have this great novel awaiting for them </li>
            <li> <input type="radio" name="q3"> it is the best work of Stevenson </li>
            <li> <input type="radio" name="q3"> it appeals to all kinds of people </li>
          </ol> <br>

          <br>
        </li>
        <li> Alan Breck and David Balfour are considered to be opposite, because
          <span id="s4"> </span>
          &emsp;<button class="b2" id="buttonhint4" type="button" onclick="toggle('hint4')">Show hint</button>
          <div id="hint4" style="display:none;">
            <p class="hint"> We can hear Louise say that ...They really are opposite. <strong>Youth</strong> with
              <strong>experience</strong>,..., a <strong>catholic</strong> with a <strong>protestant</strong>... The
              answer A says that one is yound and other is old, but experienced doesn't mean old, so both A and C is
              incorrect.<br> </p>
          </div>

          <ol type="A">
            <li> <input type="radio" name="q4"> one is young and the other is old</li>
            <li> <input type="radio" name="q4" id="a4"> one is catholic and the other is protestant </li>
            <li> <input type="radio" name="q4"> Both A and B </li>
          </ol>
        </li> <br>



        <li> It is common for Stevenson to
          <span id="s5"> </span>
          &emsp;<button class="b2" id="buttonhint5" type="button" onclick="toggle('hint5')">Show hint</button>
          <div id="hint5" style="display:none;">
            <p class="hint"> We can hear in the last part of the recording: "...I think it is <strong>typicall</strong>
              of him that these two very different people [a protagonist and a villian] actually form a wonderfull,
              loyal friendship". So we can see that B is the right answer. <br> </p>
          </div>

          <ol type="A">
            <li> <input type="radio" name="q5"> fill his works with tension </li>
            <li> <input type="radio" name="q5" id="a5"> make a protagonist and a villian form a friendship in his works
            </li>
            <li> <input type="radio" name="q5"> tell a story of a natinal/historical conflict in his works </li>
          </ol>
        </li> <br>

        <li> What part of Scottish landscape plays major role in the book?
          <span id="s6"> </span>
          &emsp;<button class="b2" id="buttonhint6" type="button" onclick="toggle('hint6')">Show hint</button>
          <div id="hint6" style="display:none;">
            <p class="hint"> One of the speakers says: "The whole landscape of Scotland is a character in the book, but
              it seems that <strong>water plays the special part</strong>..." So answer C is correct. <br> </p>
          </div>

          <ol type="A">
            <li> <input type="radio" name="q6"> Fields </li>
            <li> <input type="radio" name="q6"> Mountains </li>
            <li> <input type="radio" name="q6" id="a6"> Water </li>
          </ol>
        </li> <br>


        <li> Which of the following about Robert Louis Stevenson <strong>isn't</strong> true?
          <span id="s7"> </span>
          &emsp;<button class="b2" id="buttonhint5" type="button" onclick="toggle('hint7')">Show hint</button>
          <div id="hint7" style="display:none;">
            <p class="hint"> We can hear speakers mentioning that Stevenson was an engineering apprentice for his father
              and that he died in his forties. We also hear that Stevenson was living in the South Seas, but there is no
              evidence that he died on a ship. So answer A is correct. <br> </p>
          </div>

          <ol type="A">
            <li> <input type="radio" name="q7" id="a7"> He died on a ship </li>
            <li> <input type="radio" name="q7"> He was in his forties when he died </li>
            <li> <input type="radio" name="q7"> He was an engineering apprentice </li>
          </ol>
        </li> <br>

      </ol>
