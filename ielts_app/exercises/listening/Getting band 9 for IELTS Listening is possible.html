                    possible?</span></h4>

            <h4 class="attention fittexted_for_content_h3"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Before the
                        test</strong></span></h4>
            <p class="tip"><strong>1. Improve your general listening skills</strong></p>
            <p>The goal of IELTS Listening section is to test your listening skills. Don’t use practice tests to improve
                your score: it’s not enough! They will help you to become familiar with the test, but won’t much improve
                your listening abilities. It is much more effective to do various listening exercises, listen to general
                listening materials (radio reports, TV-shows, documental programs etc) and only after that do IELTS
                Listening practice tests.</p>
            <p class="tip"><strong>2. Polish your topic vocabulary</strong></p>
            <p>Section 3 is almost always about education. For example, students and a tutor talking about an
                assignment. Learn all the vocabulary you can about studying at university. This way you will understand
                this section better.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h4 class="attention fittexted_for_content_h3"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>On the
                        test</strong></span></h4>
            <p class="tip"><strong>3. Word types</strong></p>
            <p>Skip over the questions and decide which type of word fits in each gap. Is it a noun, verb, adverb or
                adjective? Write ‘N’ for noun, ‘V’ for verb and so on. This will help you to focus on the specific word
                forms while listening.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="tip"><strong>4. “Plug in” the situation</strong></p>
            <p>Try to get an idea of the situation. Before each part you will be given a short introduction: ‘<em>Now,
                    you will hear a dialogue betweenâ€¦</em>‘ or ‘<em>you will hear a lecture onâ€¦</em>‘ This
                information is not written on the question paper, so be attentive. Note: who are the speakers, why are
                they speaking and where are they. This will make understanding the rest of the recording much easier.
            </p>
            <p class="tip"><strong>5.Don’t loose attention</strong></p>
            <p>Remember, you will only hear the audio once. So if you didn’t hear some words and passed over some
                questions, don’t worry! Leave them blank and focus on the actual part. Review those questions at the end
                of the section, otherwise, you will only miss more questions and tangle in the recording. You will need
                to read, write and listen all at the same time.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="tip"><strong>6. Watch out words-indicators</strong></p>
            <p>Listen for words-indicators, such
                as&nbsp;<em>however</em>,&nbsp;<em>but</em>,&nbsp;<em>then</em>,&nbsp;<em>finally</em>. They help you to
                anticipate what the speaker will say.</p>
            <p class="tip"><strong>7. Don’t write answers too quickly</strong></p>
            <p>A lot of students fall into this trap: as soon as they hear the needed information, they take it for the
                correct answer. But&nbsp;<u>sometimes this information is repeated</u>&nbsp;or corrected further in the
                section. Example:<br>
                <strong>Sam</strong>: Thank you! I’ve received your email. So it is loren-hanson@gmail.com.<br>
                <strong>Loren</strong>: No-no! You have mistaken, it is loren-hamson@gmail.com, spelled with M.<br>
                <strong>Sam</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry…
            </p>
            <p class="tip"><strong>8. Check for silly mistakes</strong></p>
            <p>After each section you have 30 seconds to check your answers. It is important to check spelling, plurals
                and word forms. Remember that only correctly written answers will gain points.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="tip"><strong>9. Transfer answers accurately</strong></p>
            <p>At the end of the listening test you will have 10 minutes for transferring your answers into the answer
                sheet. And quite often students get confused in the numeration! As you write down your answers, check
                that they fit into the correct numbered space. In other words, make sure that answer for question 7 goes
                into space number 7.</p>
            <p class="tip"><strong>10. Don’t leave any blank answers!</strong></p>
            <p>You won’t lose marks for incorrect answers, so even if you don’t know the answer it is better to write
                something in the answers box. Read the question again and make a guess!</p>
