    <h3 class="attention">Procedures on the test day</h3>
    <p>The Speaking test takes place on other day and in other place than other parts of IELTS. </p>
    <ol>
        <li>After you have registered for IELTS (you can do it <b>ielts.britishcouncil.org</b>), the test
            administrator will inform you about your interview time and place.

        <li>When you come to the test centre for your Speaking test, the test administrator will
            tell you the room number when your test will take place. Close to the time of your test,
            you will be shown to a waiting area.
        <li>The examiner will call you into the test room and ask you to sit at a table facing
            him/her.
        <li>When you come to the room, the examiner will turn on a recorder and start your Speaking
            test. Don't worry about that - all interviews are recorded to make sure the Speaking
            test is fair.
