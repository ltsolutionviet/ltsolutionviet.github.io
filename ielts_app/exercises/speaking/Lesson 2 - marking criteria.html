                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    <br>
    <h2>IELTS Speaking score calculation</h2>
    <p> Each of these criteria receives a score from 0 to 9 points. After that, an arithmetic mean
        is calculated to determine the section's total score.

        For example, if your marks are: FC - 7, P - 8, LR - 7 and GR - 6, your total score will be
        (7+8+7+6)/4 = 7 </p>
    <p> For example, if your marks are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fluency and Cohesion: 7.5,</li>
        <li>Pronunciation: 7.0,</li>
        <li>Lexical Resource: 7.0,</li>
        <li>Grammatical Range and Accuracy - 7.5.</li>
    </ul>
    Then your<strong> total score for IELTS Speaking</strong> is (7.5+7.0+7.0+7.5)/4 =7.25, which
    <strong>will be rounded</strong> to 7.5.<p></p>
