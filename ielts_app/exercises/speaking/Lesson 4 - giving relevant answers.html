        and more), you should make sure that <em>your answers are relevant to the question</em>.
    </p>

    <p>The questions in IELTS Speaking test (parts 1 and 3) may ask you to do one or more of the
        following:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>describe</li>
        <li>explain</li>
        <li>suggest</li>
        <li>express a preference</li>
        <li>give an opinion</li>
        <li>compare and contrast</li>
        <li>give a reason</li>
    </ul>
    <ul type="disc">
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>Let's look at the examples below to get an idea what <em><strong>relevant
        answer</strong></em> means.</p>

    <div id="hint1" style="display:none;" class="hint"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Let's talk about
        your home town... Can you tell me something about your home town?
    </div>
    <p>This question asks you to <u><strong>describe</strong></u> your home town.</p>
    <p>Example of <span style="font-weight:bold; color:green;">relevant answer</span>: </p>
    <p class="example">My hometown is a little village located in the Western part of India... It is
        a very pleasant place with a lot of trees and nice climate. I really like it.</p>This answer
    is relevant because you <u>describe</u> your hometown in it - exactly what the question asked
    you to do.<p></p><br>


    <p>Example of <span style="font-weight:bold; color:red;">irrelevant answer</span>: </p>
    <p class="example">Hmm... I like my hometown primarily because it is a very pleasant place with
        a lot of trees and nice climate.</p> This answer is irrelevant because it <u>explains</u>
    why you like your hometown, rather than describes your hometown.<p></p><br>

    <p>Another example of <span style="font-weight:bold; color:red;">irrelevant answer</span>: </p>
    <p class="example">Currently I live in a big city, which is very different from my hometown...
        Unlike the place where I live now, my hometown is a little village. </p> This answer is
    irrelevant because it <u>compares and contrasts</u> your current place of living with your
    hometown, rather than describes your hometown.<p></p>

    <p style="font-weight:bold;">Question 2</p>

                                                            style="vertical-align: middle">Show

    </button>
    <div id="hint2" style="display:none;" class="hint"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Is your town
        different now to what it was like in the past?
    </div>

    <p>This question asks you to <u><strong>compare and contrast</strong></u> what your hometown is
        like now to what it was like in the past.</p>
    <p>Example of <span style="font-weight:bold; color:green;">relevant answer</span>: </p>
    <p class="example">Well... Nowadays my hometown is a little bit different from what it was in
        the past. During the last decade a lot of facilities - like supermarkets and gyms - were
        built... Moreover, I think it became more populated.</p>
    <p></p><br>


    <p>Example of <span style="font-weight:bold; color:red;">irrelevant answer</span>: </p>
    <p class="example">I prefer what my hometown was like in the past than what it is like now. I
        don't like crowds and a lot of people, and nowadays my hometown is really
        over-populated.</p> This answer is irrelevant because it <u>expresses a preference</u>
    rather than compares and contrasts.<p></p><br>


    <p style="font-weight:bold;">Question 3</p>

    </button>
    <div id="hint3" style="display:none;" class="hint"><strong>Examiner</strong>: What would a
        tourist like to do in your hometown?
    </div>

    <p>This question asks you to <u><strong>suggest</strong></u> things that a tourist would like to
        do in your hometown.</p>
    <p>Example of <span style="font-weight:bold; color:green;">relevant answer</span>: </p>
    <p class="example">Hmm... Firstly, there are some historical places - like ancient temples -
        that tourists would like to see in my hometown. They have been built in 10th century and are
        surrounded by a large garden, so I believe it's an amazing place to visit. Also, I think
        that tourists would find the local zoo very interesting too.</p>
    <p></p><br>


    <p>Example of <span style="font-weight:bold; color:red;">irrelevant answer</span>: </p>
    <p class="example">There are ancient temples, which are located in the Northern part of my
        hometown; they have been built in 10th century! They are very old and reveal many historical
        mysteries. They are surrounded by a large garden and are easily accessible by subway. </p>
    This answer is irrelevant because it <u>describes</u> a tourist attraction rather than suggests
    visiting it.<p></p><br>


    <p style="font-weight:bold;">Question 4</p>

    <div id="hint4" style="display:none;" class="hint"><strong>Examiner</strong>: Which city do you
        think is the most beautiful in your country?
    </div>
    <p>This question asks you to <u><strong>give an opinion</strong></u>.</p>
    <p>Example of <span style="font-weight:bold; color:green;">relevant answer</span>: </p>
    <p class="example">I believe my hometown to be the most beautiful city in my country. Probably,
        I like it so much because I was born there and spent first 19 years of my life in that
        city.</p>
    <p></p><br>


    <p>Example of <span style="font-weight:bold; color:red;">irrelevant answer</span>: </p>
    <p class="example">I like my hometown because I was born there and it is very near and dear to
        my heart. </p> This answer is irrelevant because it <u>explains</u> why you like a certain
    city rather than gives an opinion.<p></p><br>
