        <h3 align="center"> Black rats rainforest invasion 'speeded by deforestation' </h3>

        <p><strong>(A)</strong> Cutting down trees in rainforests facilitates the spread of invasive
            black rats, a study suggests.

            The rodents normally avoid mature forests with large trees as they provide little in the
            way of cover.

            But researchers, writing in Biotropica, say that logging makes rainforests more
            attractive for rats as fallen wood contains more insects which they eat.</p>
        <p><br>
            <strong>(B)</strong> Scientists are concerned that the invading black rats will be bad
            news for native mammals.

            Sometimes called the ship rat, these rodents have spread around the world over the past
            400 years, often causing the extinctions of native species and spreading disease. </p>
        <p><br>
            <strong>(C)</strong> Much of their notoriety rests on the idea that black rats were the
            origin of bubonic plague, although recent research casts doubt on that notion.

            Black rats have usually avoided older forests as they contain large trees which do not
            provide much in the way of ground level protection. They also tend to have leafy forest
            floors which are noisy for rats to run through, as they attract predators. </p>
        <p><br>
            <strong>(D)</strong> This new study examined the idea that logging of trees in
            rainforests might facilitate the spread of the rodents.

            The researchers looked at the island of Borneo where large tracts of the natural forest
            have been degraded. </p>
        <p><br>
            <strong>(E)</strong> It had been believed that black rats were confined to urban areas
            in Borneo. To test the idea that they might spread into deforested regions, the
            scientists trapped rats from four different species - they then attached small spools of
            cotton thread to their backs and and tracked their movements. </p>
        <p><br>

            <strong>(F)</strong> Across the animals in the study, the researchers found that the
            black rats had the strongest preference for the type of disturbed habitat associated
            with logging.

            The increased amount of fallen wood boosted the amount of insects which the rats eat.
            The logged forests also have more undergrowth which provides better cover. The
            researchers believe that black rats favour these small changes far more than related
            species. </p>
        <p><br>
            <strong>(G)</strong> "Logging creates micro-environments that black rats love, helping
            them move in," said study co-author Dr Rob Ewers from Imperial College London.

            "This could be bad news for native mammals who might not be able to compete with black
            rats for food and resources. It's also bad for the forest, as many small mammals are
            important seed dispersers, helping rainforest plants to grow, and they are also prey for
            larger animals."</p>
        <p><br>
            <strong>(H)</strong> The researchers say that the widespread destruction of forests
            throughout the tropics may well be multiplying the threat from invasive species like
            black rats. They believe the presence of these rats could pose a significant threat to
            nesting birds and other small mammals.

            The scientists say that the way that logging is done can have a big impact on the
            suitability of the land for the black rats.

            The more dead wood that is left behind the better the black rats like it. If felled
            trees were more accurately cleared as well as the vines that connect the trees, the
            rat's progress might be curbed. </p>

        <p><strong>Questions 1-8</strong></p>
        <p>The text has eight paragraphs <strong>A-H.</strong> Which paragraph contains the
            following information? Write the correct letter, <strong>A-H</strong>, in boxes <strong>1-8</strong>
            on your answer sheet.</p>

        <br>
        <p><strong>1. </strong>A valid concern
            <input type="text" class="ex-input" s id="ex1">
            <span id="s1"> </span> &emsp;

            <button class="b2" id="buttonhint1" type="button" onclick="toggle('hint1')">Show hint
            </button>

        </p>
        <div id="hint1" style="display:none;"><p class="hint">The correct answer is B, because in
            the paragraph B we can read that <em>"The scientists are concerned..."</em></p></div>
        <p></p>

        <br>
        <p>
            <strong>2. </strong>The experiment
            <input type="text" class="ex-input" s id="ex2">
            <span id="s2"> </span> &emsp;

            <button class="b2" id="buttonhint2" type="button" onclick="toggle('hint2')">Show hint
            </button>

        </p>
        <div id="hint2" style="display:none;"><p class="hint">Your should answer E, because in this
            paragraph there is a fragment that tells "<em>To test the idea that they might spread
                into deforested regions, the scientists trapped rats...</em>". That can be
            considered as an experiment. </p></div>
        <p></p>

        <br>
        <p><strong>3. </strong>More food for rats
            <input type="text" class="ex-input" s id="ex3">
            <span id="s3"> </span> &emsp;
            <button class="b2" id="buttonhint3" type="button" onclick="toggle('hint3')">Show hint
            </button>

        </p>
        <div id="hint3" style="display:none;"><p class="hint">The right answer for this question is
            A, because you can see that "<em>logging makes rainforests more attractive for rats as
                fallen wood contains more insects which they eat.</em>". </p></div>
        <p></p>

        <br>

        </p>
        <div id="hint4" style="display:none;"><p class="hint"> In the paragraph H we can read that "<em>...the
            widespread destruction of forests throughout the tropics may well be multiplying the
            threat from invasive species like black rats. </em>". So H is the correct answer. <br>
        </p></div>
        <p></p>


        <br>
        <p>
            <strong>5. </strong>Bad news

            </button>

        </p>
        <div id="hint5" style="display:none;"><p class="hint"> You should answer G, because in the
            second sentence we see that "<em>This could be bad news for native mammals...</em>".
        </p></div>
        <p></p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>6. </strong>A place of the research

        </p>
        <div id="hint6" style="display:none;"><p class="hint">The correct answer is D. Secon
            sentence say: "<em>.The researchers looked at the island of Borneo...</em>". It
            indicates the place of the research.</p></div>
        <p></p><br>
        <p>
            <strong>7. </strong>The difference between species<strong> </strong>
            <input type="text" class="ex-input" s id="ex7">

            <button class="b2" id="buttonhint7" type="button" onclick="toggle('hint7')">Show hint
            </button>

        </p>
        <div id="hint7" style="display:none;"><p class="hint"> The last sentence of the paragraph F
            says: "<em>The researchers believe that black rats favour these small changes far more
                than related species. </em>. Therefore, the correct answer is F. </p></div>
        <p></p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <strong>8. </strong>The reason for bad reputation

            <button class="b2" id="buttonhint8" type="button" onclick="toggle('hint8')">Show hint
            </button>

        </p>
        <div id="hint8" style="display:none;"><p class="hint"> The correct answer is C, because in
            the very beginning of this paragraph we can reas that "<em>Much of their notoriety rests
                on the idea that black rats were the origin of bubonic plague...</em>". And a bad
            reputation is a synonym to notoriety. </p></div>
