        <h3 align="center"> Peanut allergy theory backed up by new research </h3>
        <p>The effects of eating peanut products as a baby to avoid the risk of allergy have been
            backed up by new research.

            In 2015, a study claimed early exposure to peanut products could cut the risk of allergy
            by 80%.

            Now researchers say "long-lasting" allergy protection can be sustained - even when the
            snacks are later avoided for a year.

            The New England Journal of Medicine study looked at 550 children deemed prone to
            developing a peanut allergy.

            The latest paper builds on the results of the 2015 research, which was also carried out
            by King's College London and marked the first time scientists were able to suggest that
            exposing children to small amounts of peanut snacks could stave off an allergy. </p>
        <p>The new study suggests that if a child has consumed peanut snacks within the first 11
            months of life, then at the age of five they can afford to stop eating the food entirely
            for a year, and maintain no allergy.

            Lead author Prof Gideon Lack said: "[The research] clearly demonstrates that the
            majority of infants did in fact remain protected and that the protection was
            long-lasting."

            He said that part of the problem was that people lived in a "culture of food fear".

            "I believe that this fear of food allergy has become a self-fulfilling prophecy, because
            the food is excluded from the diet and, as a result, the child fails to develop
            tolerance," he told the BBC News website.

            The researchers used the same children who took part in the 2015 study - half of whom
            had been given peanut snacks as a baby while the remainder had been fed on a diet of
            breast milk alone.</p>

        <p>"The study found that at six years of age, there was no statistically significant
            increase in allergy after 12 months of avoidance, in those who had consumed peanut
            during the [2015] trial," the authors said.

            The children taking part in the study were considered prone to peanut allergy, because
            they had already developed eczema as a baby - an early warning sign of allergies.

            Prof Lack said that further studies were needed to see if the resistance lasts for
            considerably longer than the 12-month abstinence period.

            He said that in the UK and US combined, 20,000 babies a year are being diagnosed with
            peanut allergies.

            He also said that between 1995 and 2005, the number of people being diagnosed had
            trebled, and this was not because detection methods had become any more advanced as they
            had remained the same.

            Prof Barry Kay, from Imperial College London, said the study's results "point the way to
            completely fresh thinking on the mechanisms of tolerance to allergenic foods in 'at
            risk' infants".

            Speaking about both pieces of research, Michael Walker, a consultant analyst and medical
            adviser to the government, said: "Taken together these are reassuring findings that pave
            the way to stem the epidemic of peanut allergy." </p>

    <p>Answer the questions below. </p>

    <p> Write <strong>EXACTLY TWO WORDS OR A NUMBER</strong><strong> </strong>from the passage for
        each answer.</p>
    <br>
    <form>

        <ol>
            <li> What is the number of children that the New England Journal of Medicine studied?
                <input type="text" class="ex-input" style="width:210px" id="ex1" required="">
                <span id="s1"> </span>

                    hint

            </li>

            <div id="hint1" style="display:none;"><p class="hint"> The fourth sentence of the first
                paragraph says that "<em>The New England Journal of Medicine study looked at 550
                    children...</em>". So 550 is the right answer. </p></div>
            <br>


            <li> At what age can the child stop eating peanuts for a year if it has consumed peanut
                snacks within the first 11 months of life?
                <input type="text" class="ex-input" style="width:210px" id="ex2" required="">
                <span id="s2"> </span>

                    hint
                </button>
            </li>

            <div id="hint2" style="display:none;"><p class="hint">In the first sentence of the
                second paragraph we can read that "<em>...if a child has consumed peanut snacks
                    within the first 11 months of life, then at the age of five they can afford to
                    stop eating the food entirely for a year...</em>". Thus, 5 is the right answer.

                majority</u> of infants did in fact remain protected and that the protection was
