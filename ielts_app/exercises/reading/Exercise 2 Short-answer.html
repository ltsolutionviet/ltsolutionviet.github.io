        <h3 align="center"> Museum of Lost Objects: Mar Elian Monastery </h3>
        <p> For centuries, Christians and Muslims have visited the small Syrian town of al-Qaryatain
            to venerate a saint known as Mar Elian. But in August 2015, the shrine was bulldozed by
            the group that calls itself Islamic State and the multifaith community was torn apart.

            About 1,500 years ago, an elderly and pious man called Julian, from the far east of
            Mesopotamia, went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem with his disciples.

            As he travelled home, Julian had an inkling that he was going to die before he made it.
            "If such a fate befalls me," he told his companions, "put my body on an ox cart and set
            it loose. Where the oxen stop is where I should be buried." </p>
        <p>Julian did indeed die, his body was loaded on to the cart, and the oxen plodded on until
            they came to a stop near a small town. Julian's disciples built a tomb for him and in
            time a monastery grew up around the shrine.

            That at least is the legend of St Julian the Old Man, or, as he is known in Arabic, Mar
            Elian. What's certainly true is that Mar Elian's shrine has existed since at least the
            6th Century, near the remote town of al-Qaryatain, located in the desert between
            Damascus and Palmyra.

            Mar Elian is not only venerated as a saint by Christians, however.

            The local Sunni population regard him as a Sufi leader and call him Sheikh Ahmed Ghouri
            ("ghouri" means "priest"). Until its destruction last year, Mar Elian's sarcophagus was
            draped in green satin, a traditional mark of homage to a Sufi holy man. </p>

        <p>When the British archaeologist, Emma Loosley, travelled to al-Qaryatain 15 years ago to
            excavate and redevelop the monastery she found the tumbledown ruins of the original
            complex, a run-down church from the 1930s and a friendly priest - Father Jacques Murad -
            who immediately decamped to a house in a nearby village.

            "We couldn't cause any scandal by sleeping in the same place," she says. "That meant I
            was the only permanent resident of the monastery at that point, and I had to live in
            this half-ruined mud-brick tower in the corner of the cloister.

            "Our shower was tainted because the well had sulphur, so I used to smell like rotten
            eggs every time I washed."

            But the Qurwani, the people of al-Qaryatain, made up for the grotty living conditions.
            Loosley found the remote desert community to be remarkably open-hearted and tolerant.
            They even had a myth to explain why Sunni Muslims and Christians - who accounted for
            about a fifth of the population in 2001 - lived together so harmoniously.

            "Their belief is that there were two tribes living in this place," says Loosley.

            "With the coming of Islam, the tribes got together and they decided that one tribe would
            stay Christian and that the other one would try the new religion.

            "Then they had a pact that whichever religion became dominant, they would look after
            their brothers who stayed in the minority religion." </p>

    <p>Answer the questions below. </p>

    <p> Write <strong>NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS </strong><strong> </strong>from the passage for each
        answer.</p>
    <br>
    <form>

        <ol>
            <li>Christians and Muslims were visiting al-Qaryatain to appreciate what saint?
                <input type="text" class="ex-input" style="width:210px" id="ex1" required="">
                <span id="s1"> </span>

                <button class="b2" id="buttonhint1" type="button" onclick="toggle('hint1')">Show
                    hint
                </button>
            </li>

            <div id="hint1" style="display:none;"><p class="hint"> The first sentence of the first
                paragraph says that "<em>...Christians and Muslims have visited the small Syrian
                    town of al-Qaryatain to venerate a saint known as Mar Elian.</em>" So you should
                answer "Mar Elian". </p></div>
            <br>


            <li> What local population regard

                Mar Elian as a Sufi leader?
                <input type="text" class="ex-input" style="width:210px" id="ex2" required="">
                <span id="s2"> </span>

                <button class="b2" id="buttonhint2" type="button" onclick="toggle('hint2')">Show
                    hint
                </button>
            </li>

            <div id="hint2" style="display:none;"><p class="hint">At the end of the second paragraph
                we can read that "<em>The local Sunni population regard him as a Sufi leader and
                    call him Sheikh Ahmed Ghouri ("ghouri" means "priest")</em>". This means that
                yous should write "Sunni" as the answer to this question.</p></div>
            <br>

            <li> Who found the tumbledown ruins of the original complex?
                <input type="text" class="ex-input" style="width:210px" id="ex3" required="">
                <span id="s3"> </span>

                <button class="b2" id="buttonhint3" type="button" onclick="toggle('hint3')">Show
                    hint
                </button>
            </li>

            <div id="hint3" style="display:none;"><p class="hint"> The first sentence of the last
                paragraph says: "<em>...Emma Loosley, travelled to al-Qaryatain 15 years ago to
                    excavate and redevelop the monastery she found the tumbledown ruins of the
                    original complex...</em>" So the correct answer is "Emma Loosley".</p></div>
            <br>


            <li> What did the community have to explain why Sunni Muslims and Christians lived
                together in harmony?
                <input type="text" class="ex-input" style="width:210px" id="ex4" required="">
                <span id="s4"> </span>

                <button class="b2" id="buttonhint4" type="button" onclick="toggle('hint4')">Show
                    hint
                </button>
            </li>

            <div id="hint4" style="display:none;"><p class="hint"> In the last paragraph we can read
                that "<em>They even had <u>a myth</u> to explain why Sunni Muslims and Christians -
                    who accounted for about a fifth of the population in 2001 - lived together so
                    harmoniously.</em>" So you should answer "a myth" </p></div>
