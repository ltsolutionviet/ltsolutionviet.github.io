    <p>In this exercise we'll <strong>improve your scanning technique for IELTS Reading</strong>. As
        you know, <u><em>scanning</em></u> means searching for specific phrases in the text to
        answer the questions. </p>
    <p>The best way to practice scanning is to search specific key words in the text to find answers
        for the questions. <strong>Scanning answering strategy</strong>: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Read the question.</li>
        <li>Detect the key words in the question.</li>
        <li>Scan the text for the key words to find the right answer.</li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>

    <p>Remember that <u>scanning is only one possible answering technique</u> and you shouldn't use
        it all the time! But still it's very convenient and is worth using.</p>
    <br>

    <h3>Practice</h3>
    <p>Answer the questions below <strong>WITHOUT READING THE TEXT</strong>, use <em>only
        scanning</em> technique to complete this exercise.</p>
    <p>There will be different types of questions presented.</p>

        <p align="center" style="font-weight:bold;"> I'm allergic to my husband </p>
        <p> Twenty-nine-year-old Johanna Watkins from Minnesota cannot kiss her husband Scott, or
            even spend time in the same room as him. She suffers from Mast Cell Activation Syndrome,
            a rare disorder of the immune system, which means she is allergic to almost everything,
            including her husband's scent. </p>
        <p>Johanna and Scott Watkins's date nights are very different from other couples.

            "Scott and I will try to watch a show together. We can't be in the room together,
            because I'm allergic to him, but he will be three floors below me in a room on his
            laptop and I will be on mine and we'll watch the show at the same time and then text
            about it as we're watching it," says Johanna.</p>
        <p>Johanna lives in an attic room all by herself with sealed windows and doors, and air
            filters to purify the air. She has a severe form of Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS)
            in which the cells that are meant to protect her from outside threats mutate and start
            attacking her body instead. The symptoms and severity of the disease can vary from
            patient to patient, but it makes Johanna allergic to virtually everything and can
            trigger life-threatening anaphylactic shock.</p>
        <p>Before she married her husband Scott in 2013 Johanna did not expect her condition to
            become so severe. She worked as a teacher and the couple used to love hiking together.
            Even then she struggled with unusual rashes, irritable bowel syndrome and migraines, but
            these ailments became much worse after the couple married.

            "There were times three and four years ago, before we got the diagnosis, that if I was
            extra close to my wife, specifically if my face was close to Johanna's face, she would
            cough," says Scott. But it was only last year that the couple realised they had become
            unable to physically share their life together.</p>
        <p>"We had noticed that when Scott would come in [to the room] I would start feeling worse
            and worse. My normal daily symptoms would just be aggravated," says Johanna. "And then
            at one point he went to get his haircut and came back in the room and within two minutes
            I had started my anaphylactic symptoms and he had to leave."

            A week later Scott tried to see his wife again, but the same thing happened, and they
            realised their lives would have to change dramatically.

            "It was this horrible reality that it wasn't going to work," says Johanna. "I was now
            reacting strongly to my husband. Before this I had reacted to my parents, to many, many
            other people, but it was horrific when it became Scott."</p>
        <p>The treatment and medication that is usually given to MCAS sufferers does not help
            Johanna, so at the moment the couple do not know when - if ever - their situation will
            change.

            "There's not an easy way around this problem. I want to keep Johanna safe and me going
            to see her compromises her safety," says Scott. "One of the ways I can take care of her
            now is by not going to see her. I'm not going to endanger her life. We're absolutely
            committed to one another and we're going to wait as long as it takes to see if there is
            some kind of healing." </p>
        <p>Doctors are trying different treatments, but none so far have helped.

            "They don't know if I will get well, and so we hope and we pray that I will," says
            Johanna. "I have had anaphylaxis, which is a life-threatening allergic reaction, more
            times than we can keep track of. My life could end quickly. Life is frail - it can end."

            But Scott will be part of her life for as long as it continues, she says.

            "On our wedding day we made vows to each other that till death do us part. No matter
            what life brought.

            "I can tell you that even if I have this until I'm 90 years old, I would be committed to
            my husband with that vow and still love him."</p>

        <p>Scott says they do sometimes get angry and frustrated about their situation.

            "I've had to release a lot of what I expected for myself and I've had to accept what has
            been given to us," says Scott.

            He adds: "Johanna and I are good at talking, we talk a lot, we try to communicate a lot,
            so one thing that we've found that's helpful is just bringing each other into what's
            going on in our lives as best we can because we're not able to be together."</p>

        <p>Scott works full-time as a teacher and then returns home every evening to cook Johanna's
            food.

            "It's one of the ways that I can care for her, and every other day for the past year
            I've had one of my dear friends come and they help [me] cook for Johanna," he says. "She
            can only eat two meals, so she's been eating the same two meals for over a year."

            Johanna can only tolerate 15 different foods, including spices, so she eats either beef
            chuck roast (beef stew) with organic celery, carrot and parsnip or organic lamb with
            turmeric, cinnamon and cucumber.</p>

        <p>The couple are currently living in the family home of their friends, the Olsons, while
            their own home is renovated to make it a safe living space for Johanna. The Olson family
            have given up using all scented products and do not cook in their house at all.

            "I have had severe reactions to someone smoking a cigarette down the block," says
            Johanna. "I have had severe reactions to the pizza place that's a mile down the street,
            and all my windows are closed and sealed in the room with special filters. </p>

        <p>"But just if the wind blows it on the right direction that day and I get even a whiff I
            can have a severe reaction. The house is quite large and I'm at the top level, and if an
            onion were to be cut in the kitchen I have had a severe reaction."

            Johanna has not left the attic room for more than a year, except to visit the hospital
            in an emergency or to see her doctor. Every morning she listens to a playlist of songs
            and then might write or answer an email to a friend, or video-call her young
            nieces. </p>
        <p>The only people she does not have a life-threatening reaction to are her siblings, who
            help take care of her. Before they enter her room, they have to avoid eating strongly
            spiced food, shower with a special soap and strip down to their underwear. As soon as
            they walk in, they put on masks and special clothes that have never left Johanna's room.

            Despite all these precautions, Johanna's symptoms still become worse after their visit.

            "I think growing up in America, it's common for us to just think, 'Oh OK if there's a
            disease there'll be a medical solution, it will be fixed and I'll move on with my
            life,'" says Johanna. "So being diagnosed and becoming this ill, [there was] definitely
            a grieving process that I went through."

            But the fact that Scott is downstairs in the same house and that she can talk to him on
            the phone is a huge comfort, says Johanna.

            "I have many gifts in my life, many blessings that I have to be thankful for," she says.
            "And that reminds me to not become selfish and just make it all about me."</p>
