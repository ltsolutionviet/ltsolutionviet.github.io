    <h3>Practice</h3>
    <p><strong>Read the text and label the diagram below</strong>.</p>
    <div class="exam-text">
        <p align="center" style="font-weight:bold;"> The chicken egg</p>
        <p>&emsp; Chicken egg consists of six main parts: albumin, yolk, shell, germinal disc,
            chalaza and air cell. In further paragraphs we will learn all the important information
            you need to know about these parts.</p>

        <p>&emsp; One of the main parts of the egg is yolk - the yellow, inner part of the egg where
            the embryo will form. The yolk contains the food that will nourish the embryo as it
            grows. Yolk is a major source of vitamins, minerals, almost half of the protein, and all
            of the fat and cholesterol. The yolk contains less water and more protein than the white
            part of the egg, some fat, and most of the vitamins and minerals of the egg. The yolk is
            also a source of lecithin, an effective emulsifier. Yolk color ranges from just a hint
            of yellow to a magnificent deep orange, according to the feed and breed of the hen. Yolk
            is anchored by chalaza - a spiral, rope-like strand that anchors the yolk in the thick
            egg white. There are two chalazae anchoring each yolk; one on the top and one on the
            bottom. </p>

        <p>&emsp; Another very important part of the egg is the albumin, which is the inner thick
            white part of the egg. This part of the egg is a excellent source of riboflavin and
            protein. In high-quality eggs, the inner thick albumen stands higher and spreads less
            than thin white. In low-quality eggs, it appears thin white.</p>

        <p>&emsp; Now let's talk about the outer part of the egg - the shell It is a hard,
            protective coating of the egg. It is semi-permeable; it lets gas exchange occur, but
            keeps other substances from entering the egg. The shell is made of calcium carbonate and
            is covered with as many as 17,000 tiny pores.</p>

        <p>&emsp; Air cell is an air space that forms when the contents of the egg cool and contract
            after the egg is laid. The air cell usually rests between the outer and inner membranes
            at the eggs larger end. As the egg ages, moisture and carbon dioxide leave through the
            pores of the shell, air enters to replace them and the air cell becomes larger.</p>

        <p>&emsp; And last but not least, let's look at the germinal disc. It's a small, circular,
            white spot (2-3 mm across) on the surface of the yolk; it is where the sperm enters the
            egg. The nucleus of the egg is in the blastodisc. The embryo develops from this disk,
            and gradually sends blood vessels into the yolk to use it for nutrition as the embryo
            develops. </p>

    </div>

    <br> <br>
    <p>Complete the diagram below. </p>

    <p> Write <strong>NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS</strong> from the passage for each answer. Do not write
        articles.</p>

                <div id="hint1" style="display:none;"><p class="hint"> You can read in the first
                    sentence of the fourth paragraph: "Now let's talk about the outer part of the
                    egg - the <em>shell</em> It is a hard, protective coating of the egg. So the
                    first part of the diagram should be labeled <em>shell</em>. </p></div>

                    read about the <em>germinal disc</em>, which is descibed as "a small, circular,
                    white spot (2-3 mm across) on the surface of the yolk". And it means that <em>germinal
                        disc</em> is the correct answer for the question 2. </p></div>

                <div id="hint3" style="display:none;"><p class="hint">In the end of the second we
                    can read that "Yolk is anchored by <em>chalaza</em> - a spiral, rope-like strand
                    that anchors the yolk in the thick egg white. There are two chalazae anchoring
                    each yolk; one on the top and one on the bottom. This description makes it clear
                    that <em>chalaza</em> is the right answer to the question 3. </p></div>

                <div id="hint4" style="display:none;"><p class="hint"> The first question of the
                    third paragraph says: "Another very important part of the egg is the
                    <em>albumin</em>, which is the inner thick white part of the egg. So
                    <em>albumin</em> is the answer to the 4 question. </p></div>

                <div id="hint5" style="display:none;"><p class="hint"> It second paragraph we can
                    read about <em>yolk</em>. "One of the main parts of the egg is yolk - the
                    yellow, inner part of the egg where the embryo will form..." It means that you
                    should answer <em>yolk</em> in the 5 question. </p></div>

                <li>

                </li>

                <div id="hint6" style="display:none;"><p class="hint"> Fifth paragraph tells us
                    about the <em>air cell</em>. "Air cell is an air space that forms when the
                    contents of the egg cool and contract after the egg is laid. The air cell
                    usually rests between the outer and inner membranes at the eggs larger end".
                    This clearly indicates that <em>air cell</em> is the right answer to the
