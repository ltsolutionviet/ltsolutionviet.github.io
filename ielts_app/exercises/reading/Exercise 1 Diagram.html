            <p align="center" style="font-weight:bold;"> The chicken egg</p>
            <p>&emsp; Chicken egg consists of six main parts: albumin, yolk, shell, germinal disc,
                chalaza and air cell. In further paragraphs we will learn all the important information
                you need to know about these parts.</p>

            <p>&emsp; One of the main parts of the egg is yolk - the yellow, inner part of the egg where
                the embryo will form. The yolk contains the food that will nourish the embryo as it
                grows. Yolk is a major source of vitamins, minerals, almost half of the protein, and all
                of the fat and cholesterol. The yolk contains less water and more protein than the white
                part of the egg, some fat, and most of the vitamins and minerals of the egg. The yolk is
                also a source of lecithin, an effective emulsifier. Yolk color ranges from just a hint
                of yellow to a magnificent deep orange, according to the feed and breed of the hen. Yolk
                is anchored by chalaza - a spiral, rope-like strand that anchors the yolk in the thick
                egg white. There are two chalazae anchoring each yolk; one on the top and one on the
                bottom. </p>

            <p>&emsp; Another very important part of the egg is the albumin, which is the inner thick
                white part of the egg. This part of the egg is a excellent source of riboflavin and
                protein. In high-quality eggs, the inner thick albumen stands higher and spreads less
                than thin white. In low-quality eggs, it appears thin white.</p>

            <p>&emsp; Now let's talk about the outer part of the egg - the shell It is a hard,
                protective coating of the egg. It is semi-permeable; it lets gas exchange occur, but
                keeps other substances from entering the egg. The shell is made of calcium carbonate and
                is covered with as many as 17,000 tiny pores.</p>

            <p>&emsp; Air cell is an air space that forms when the contents of the egg cool and contract
                after the egg is laid. The air cell usually rests between the outer and inner membranes
                at the eggs larger end. As the egg ages, moisture and carbon dioxide leave through the
                pores of the shell, air enters to replace them and the air cell becomes larger.</p>

            <p>&emsp; And last but not least, let's look at the germinal disc. It's a small, circular,
                white spot (2-3 mm across) on the surface of the yolk; it is where the sperm enters the
                egg. The nucleus of the egg is in the blastodisc. The embryo develops from this disk,
                and gradually sends blood vessels into the yolk to use it for nutrition as the embryo
                develops. </p>

                            white spot (2-3 mm across) on the surface of the yolk". And it means that <em>germinal
                                disc</em> is the correct answer for the question 2. </p>

                            each yolk; one on the top and one on the bottom. This description makes it clear
                            that <em>chalaza</em> is the right answer to the question 3. </p>

                            <em>albumin</em> is the answer to the 4 question.

                            read about <em>yolk</em>. "One of the main parts of the egg is yolk - the
                            yellow, inner part of the egg where the embryo will form..." It means that you
                            should answer <em>yolk</em> in the 5 question. </p>

                        <p class="hint"> Fifth paragraph tells us
                            about the <em>air cell</em>. "Air cell is an air space that forms when the

                            usually rests between the outer and inner membranes at the eggs larger end".
                            This clearly indicates that <em>air cell</em> is the right answer to the
