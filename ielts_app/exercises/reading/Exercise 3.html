    <h2>Exercise 3 </h2>
    <p>Read the text and answer the questions below.</p>

    <div class="exam-text">
        <p align="center" style="font-weight:bold;"> Is there such a thing as Canadian English? If
            so, what is it? </p>
        <p>&emsp; The standard stereotype among Americans is that Canadians are like Americans,
            except they say ‘eh’ a lot and pronounce ‘out and about’ as ‘oot and aboot’. Many
            Canadians, on the other hand, will tell you that Canadian English is more like British
            English, and as proof will hold aloft the spellings colour and centre and the name zed
            for the letter Z. </p>
        <p>&emsp; Canadian does exist as a separate variety of British English, with subtly
            distinctive features of pronunciation and vocabulary. It has its own dictionaries; the
            Canadian Press has its own style guide; the Editors’ Association of Canada has just
            released a second edition of Editing Canadian English. But an emblematic feature of
            Editing Canadian English is comparison tables of American versus British spellings so
            the Canadian editor can come to a reasonable decision on which to use… on each occasion.
            The core of Canadian English is a pervasive ambivalence. </p>
        <p>&emsp; Canadian history helps to explain this. In the beginning there were the indigenous
            people, with far more linguistic and cultural variety than Europe. They’re still there,
            but Canadian English, like Canadian Anglophone society in general, gives them little
            more than desultory token nods. Fights between European settlers shaped Canadian English
            more. The French, starting in the 1600s, colonised the St Lawrence River region and the
            Atlantic coast south of it. In the mid-1700s, England got into a war with France,
            concluding with the Treaty of Paris in 1763, which ceded ‘New France’ to England. The
            English allowed any French to stay who were willing to become subjects of the English
            King.</p>
        <p>&emsp; At the time of the Treaty of Paris, however, there were very few English speakers
            in Canada. The American Revolution changed that. The founding English-speaking people of
            Canada were United Empire Loyalists – people who fled American independence and were
            rewarded with land in Canada. Thus Canadian English was, from its very beginning, both
            American – because its speakers had come from the American colonies – and not American,
            because they rejected the newly independent nation. </p>
        <p>&emsp; Just as the Americans sought to have a truly distinct, independent American
            version of English, the loyalists sought to remain more like England… sort of. These
            were people whose variety of English was already diverging from the British and vice
            versa: when the residents of London and its environs began to drop their r’s and change
            some of their vowels people in certain parts of the United States adopted some of these
            changes, but Canadians did not. </p>

        <ol>
            <li> Canadian English is considered more like British English by canadians.
                <select id="select1">
                    <option>Choose</option>
                    <option value="1">TRUE</option>

                </button>
            </li>
            <br>

            <div id="hint1" style="display:none;"><p class="hint"> The first paragraph tells us that
                "<em>Many Canadians, on the other hand, will tell you that Canadian English is more
                    like British English...</em>". So it is true to say that canadians consider
                their English to be close to British. </p></div>
            <br>


            <li> According to the secod paragraph, Canadian English is pretty similar to British,
                with some minor differences.
                <select id="select2">
                    <option value="1">TRUE</option>

            <div id="hint2" style="display:none;"><p class="hint"> In the second paragraph we can
                read that "<em>Canadian does exist as a separate variety of British English, with
                    subtly distinctive features of pronunciation and vocabulary</em>", so statement
                is true. </p></div>
            <br>


            <li> The St Lawrence River was colonised by Canadians in 1600.
                <select id="select3">
                    <option>TRUE</option>

            <br>

            <div id="hint3" style="display:none;"><p class="hint">It is said in the third paragraph:
                "<em>The French, starting in the 1600s, colonised the St Lawrence River...</em>". So
                the river was colonised by French, not Canadians.</p></div>
            <br>


            <li> Canadian English is considered neither American nor not American.
                <select id="select4">
                    <option>TRUE</option>
                    <option value="1">FALSE</option>

                </button>
            </li>
            <br>

            <div id="hint4" style="display:none;"><p class="hint"> In the fourth paragraph we see: "<em>...Canadian
                English was, from its very beginning, <u>both</u> American – because its speakers
                had come from the American colonies – and not American...</em>" , so the stament is
                false. </p></div>
            <br>

            <li> The fifth paragraph states that many English-speaking countries adopted changes in
                pronounciation.
                <select id="select5">
                    <option>TRUE</option>

            <div id="hint5" style="display:none;"><p class="hint"> According to the fifth paragraph
                "<em>...people in certain parts of the United States adopted some of these changes,
                    but Canadians did not.</em>" So we cannot say with the authority that some other
                countries, apart from the USA, adopted these changes. Thus, the answer in not given.
