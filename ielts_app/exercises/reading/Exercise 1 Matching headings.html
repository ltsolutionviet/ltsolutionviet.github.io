        <h3 align="center"> Simplicity reigns at London's biggest design festival. </h3>

        <p><strong>(A)</strong> With upwards of 300 product launches, installations and exhibitions,
            London's annual nine-day design festival is a showcase of head-spinning choice.

            In many ways that's the beauty of the extravaganza, everyone has a different experience
            and takes something unique away from it. There were however some intriguing themes and
            trends in this year's edition that spoke to larger social or cultural preoccupations.
        </p>
        <p><br>
            <strong>(B)</strong> One was the launch of two consumer electronics products designed to
            simplify and beautify our technology-addled lives. Both chose the new London Design
            Festival venue of Somerset House to show their wares.

            The first was a mobile phone launched by Swiss company Punkt and designed by Jasper
            Morrison that allows users to make calls and texts only (well, it has an alarm clock and
            an address book too). Punkt founder Petter Neby doesn't believe it will replace your
            smart phone but suggests users fit it with the same SIM card as your main phone and use
            it in the evenings, weekends and on holiday. </p>
        <p><br>
            <strong>(C)</strong> The other electronics launch came from the unlikely French sibling
            duo of the Bouroullec brothers. Though tech companies like Samsung are usually
            prescriptive about their products the Bouroullecs (who admitted they found most TVs sad
            and ugly) seem to have been given free rein.

            Their new television for the mega Korean brand looks more like an item of furniture than
            an ultra-large and ultra-slim piece of tech. More importantly, it comes with simplified
            on-screen interaction and a 'curtain mode' that turns your screen into a shimmering
            pattern during ads or half-time. Again, their focus was on dialing down digital
            insanity. </p>
        <p><br>
            <strong>(D)</strong> Customizable online furniture was also very much in vogue at this
            year's festival. But rest assured, weird and unreliable software or off-the-wall designs
            sent to a 3D printer somewhere and arriving months later, seem to be a thing of the
            past.

            Customization may finally have come of age. Two examples were Scandi-brand Hem that
            combinded good design by the likes of Luca Nichetto, Form Us With Love and Sylvain
            Willenz with affordable price points. The fact that the brand opened a pop-up store in
            Covent Garden during the festival is a recognition of the importance of both physical
            and online spaces that work seamlessly together.</p>
        <p><br>
            <strong>(E)</strong> Another online configurable brand to make its debut after years in
            development was Warsaw-based Tylko. Like Hem, Tylko has spent time and money on very
            powerful and easy-to-use software, but with only three designs - a table, a shelf and
            salt and pepper mills - it has a way to go. Its augmented reality app is simple to use
            however and its table has been developed with a nano-coating option that really does
            appear to keep pesky stains at bay.

            Craft and 'making' in all its forms was once again a big hit and nowhere more so than at
            TENT, the East London design event that gets better every year. </p>
        <p><br>

            <strong>(F)</strong> A definite highlight was the massive space taken over by the Design
            &amp; Crafts Council of Ireland and filled with weavers and potters doing their thing
            and showing their wares.

            Irish Design had another delectable stand over at the Rochelle School in East London
            too. The Souvenir Project was a series of nine non-cliché 'souvenirs' made in Ireland
            and included a rainbow plate by Nicholas Mosse Pottery that featured rows of animals,
            flowers and watering cans and commemorated the legalization of same-sex marriage in
            Ireland in May 2015. </p>
        <p><br>
            <strong>(G)</strong> If there was one material that could be said to define the festival
            it might just be Jesmonite, the wonder man-made building composite. Lighter and more
            sustainable than concrete, its dramatic capabilities were brought to life by
            London-based design studio PINCH and their tour-de-force limited edition Nim table and
            Swedish artist Hilda Hellström's giant colorful volcano made for the restaurant in
            London's Ace Hotel.

            A show called Matter of Stuff near Covent Garden was in on the jesmonite act too, but
            even more intriguingly was presenting vases made out of Propolis, a resinous material
            collected by bees and used to seal gaps in hives that, according to their designer
            Marlene Huissoud, behaves like glass.</p>
        <p><br>
            <strong>(H)</strong> Finally, this was the year that Chinese Design finally displayed a
            well-edited and inspired showcase of products. Despite the mouthful of a title, Icon
            Presents: Hi Design Shanghai stand at 100% Design was a meaningful selection of
            designers exploring materials and ideas.

            Young design duo Yuue's offerings were the most representative of a new conceptual
            approach to design that seems to be emerging. Their lamps were functional but also
            thought-provoking and humorous. What more could one want from the stuff that surrounds
            us?</p>

    <br>
    <br>

    <form>

        <p><strong>Questions 1-8</strong></p>
        <p>The text has eight paragraphs <strong>A-H.</strong> Which paragraph contains the
            following information? Write the correct letter, <strong>A-H</strong>, in boxes <strong>1-8</strong>
            on your answer sheet.</p>

        <br>
        <p><strong>1. </strong>Examples of customization
            <input type="text" class="ex-input" s id="ex1">
            <span id="s1"> </span> &emsp;

            <button class="b2" id="buttonhint1" type="button" onclick="toggle('hint1')">Show hint
            </button>

        </p>
        <div id="hint1" style="display:none;"><p class="hint">The correct answer is D, because in
            the paragraph D we can see that the author is talking about customization: <em>"<u>Customizable</u>
                online furniture... Customization may finally have come of age. Two examples
                were..."</em></p></div>
        <p></p>

        <br>
        <p>
            <strong>2. </strong>Unusual keepsakes
            <input type="text" class="ex-input" s id="ex2">
            <span id="s2"> </span> &emsp;

            <button class="b2" id="buttonhint2" type="button" onclick="toggle('hint2')">Show hint
            </button>

        </p>
        <div id="hint2" style="display:none;"><p class="hint">Your answer should be F, because in
            this paragraph there is a fragment that tells "<em>a series of nine <u>non-cliché
                'souvenirs'</u></em>" which is a synonym to unusual keepsakes. </p></div>
        <p></p>

        <br>
        <p><strong>3. </strong>A new approach
            <input type="text" class="ex-input" s id="ex3">
            <span id="s3"> </span> &emsp;
            <button class="b2" id="buttonhint3" type="button" onclick="toggle('hint3')">Show hint
            </button>

        </p>
        <div id="hint3" style="display:none;"><p class="hint">The correct answer is H, because you
            can see a line about "<em>a new conceptual approach to design</em>" in the third
            sentence of paragraph H. </p></div>
        <p></p>

        <br>
        <p><strong>4.</strong> A simple cell phone
            <input type="text" class="ex-input" s id="ex4">
            <span id="s4"> </span> &emsp;
            <button class="b2" id="buttonhint4" type="button" onclick="toggle('hint4')">Show hint
            </button>

        </p>
        <div id="hint4" style="display:none;"><p class="hint"> The correct answer is B, because in
            the paragraph B we can read about new cell phone, "<em>that allows users to make calls
                and texts only</em>". Therefore, it is simple. <br></p>


            <p></p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>
            <strong>5. </strong>Unbelievable material
            <input type="text" class="ex-input" s id="ex5">
            <span id="s5"> </span> &emsp;

            <button class="b2" id="buttonhint5" type="button" onclick="toggle('hint5')">Show hint
            </button>

        </p>
        <div id="hint5" style="display:none;"><p class="hint"> In the paragraph G we're told about "<em>Jesmonite,
            the <u>wonder man-made building composite</u>. Lighter and more sustainable than
            concrete...</em>". Due to such qualities, this material can be described as unbelivable.
        </p></div>
        <p></p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>6. </strong>A strange TV
            <input type="text" class="ex-input" s id="ex6">
            <span id="s6"> </span> &emsp;


            <button class="b2" id="buttonhint6" type="button" onclick="toggle('hint6')">Show hint
            </button>


        </p>
        <div id="hint6" style="display:none;"><p class="hint">The correct answer is C. Third
            sentence confirms it: "<em>...new <u>television</u> for the mega Korean brand <u>looks
                more like an item of furniture</u> than an ultra-large and ultra-slim piece of
                tech...</em>". </p></div>
        <p></p><br>
        <p>
            <strong>7. </strong>Number of products shown on the festival<strong> </strong>
            <input type="text" class="ex-input" s id="ex7">
            <span id="s7"> </span> &emsp;


            <button class="b2" id="buttonhint7" type="button" onclick="toggle('hint7')">Show hint
            </button>

        </p>
        <div id="hint7" style="display:none;"><p class="hint"> The very first line of the first
            paragraph says: "<em>With upwards of <u>300 product launches, installations and
                exhibitions</u>, London's annual nine-day design festival is a showcase of
                head-spinning choice</em>. So the right answer is A. </p></div>
        <p></p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <strong>8. </strong>Three designs of a software
            <input type="text" class="ex-input" s id="ex8">
            <span id="s8"> </span> &emsp;


            <button class="b2" id="buttonhint8" type="button" onclick="toggle('hint8')">Show hint
            </button>

        </p>
        <div id="hint8" style="display:none;"><p class="hint"> E is the correct answer, because the
            second sentence of paragraph E says that "<em>...Tylko has spent time and money on very
                powerful and easy-to-use <u>software, but with only three designs</u> - a table, a
                shelf and salt and pepper mills...</em>". </p></div>
