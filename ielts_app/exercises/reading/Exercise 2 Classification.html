        <p>This is a second exercise for <em><strong>classification questions in IELTS Reading</strong></em>.
            This exercise aims to help you in developing your reading techniques for classification
            tasks.</p>
        <p>Just to remind you, in classification questions you're given some options (A, B, C etc.) and
            a list of statements. You have to read the article, and connect each statement to one
            option.</p>


        <p>Let's start. <strong>Read the text and answer the questions below</strong>.</p>

            <p align="center" style="font-weight:bold;">New pattern in planet's energy flow</p>

            <noindex>
                <p>The impact humans have made on Earth in terms of how we produce and consume resources
                    has formed a 'striking new pattern' in the planet's global energy flow, according to
                    researchers from the University of Leicester.</p>
                <p>Archaeologist Dr Matthew Edgeworth, Honorary Visiting Research Fellow at the
                    University of Leicester's School of Archaeology and Ancient History, said: "Earth is
                    now characterised by a geologically unprecedented pattern of global energy flow that
                    is pervasively influenced by humans - and which is necessary for maintaining the
                    complexity of modern human societies."</p>
                <p>Professor Zalasiewicz said: "Very big changes in our planet's pattern of biological
                    production and consumption do not happen very often. The appearance of
                    photosynthesis was one, about two and a half billion years ago. Then, a little over
                    half a billion years ago, animals like trilobites appeared, to add scavengers and
                    predators into a food web of increasing complexity. Other major events have happened
                    since, such as five major mass extinctions, but even measured against these events,
                    human-driven changes to production and consumption are distinctly new."</p>
                <p>Dr Carys Bennett, co-author on the study from the University of Leicester's
                    Department of Geology, added: "It is without precedent to have a single species
                    appropriating something like one quarter of the net primary biological production of
                    the planet and to become effectively the top predator both on land and at sea.</p>
                <p>In addition, by digging phosphorus out of the ground and by fixing nitrogen out of
                    the air to make fertilizers; and by exploiting hundreds of millions of years-worth
                    of stored carbon-based energy in a still-accelerating trend, humans are increasing
                    productivity well above natural levels - and directing much of it towards animals
                    that have been re-engineered to suit our purposes. "</p>
                <p>Professor Zalasiewicz added: "The relationship between Earth's production and
                    consumption is being refashioned, and this is the key feature to characterize the
                    Anthropocene as a geological time unit. It also has wider and more fundamental
                    importance in signaling a new biological stage in this planet's evolution."</p>
                <p>Dr Matthew Edgeworth added: "Recent changes in Earth's biosphere, caused in part by
                    human activity, are starting to become evident in rock and soil strata.
                    Unprecedented stratigraphic signals are challenging disciplines like geology and
                    archaeology to assess such changes and put them in temporal context, relative to
                    other major transitions in Earth's history."</p>
                <p>Dr Carys Bennett said: "Modern human society is structured around economic production
                    and consumption and our recent perturbation of the balance between the two, notably
                    since the mid-20th century, will leave a signal that will provide a lasting legacy
                    of our existence on this planet."</p>
                <p>Professor Zalasiewicz concluded that we should gather more evidence on the
                    Anthropocene, which will help inform recommendations on whether this new time unit
                    should be formalized and, if so, how it might be defined and characterized.</p>
