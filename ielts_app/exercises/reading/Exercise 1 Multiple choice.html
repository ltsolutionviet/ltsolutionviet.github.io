    <h2>Exercise 1</h2>
    <p>Read the text and answer the questions below.</p>
    <div class="exam-text">
        <p align="center" style="font-weight:bold;"> Is violence innate? </p>
        <p>&emsp; In 1983, archaeologists in southern Germany discovered a mass grave containing 34
            skeletons. They included 9 adult males, 7 adult females and 16 children.</p>
        <p>&emsp; All of the skeletons showed signs of fatal trauma, including head wounds. None of
            them showed any signs of defensive wounds, suggesting they were killed whilst running
            away.</p>
        <p>&emsp; The "Talheim Death Pit" dates from the Stone Age, around 7,000 years ago. It
            offers some of the oldest evidence of organised group violence between two communities:
            that is, of war.</p>
        <p>&emsp; Clearly, humans have been fighting wars for thousands of years, and we may not be
            the only ones. There is growing evidence that several other species also engage in
            warfare, including our closest relatives the chimpanzees.</p>
        <p>&emsp; That suggests we have inherited our predilection for warfare from our ape-like
            ancestors. But not everyone agrees that warfare is inbuilt.</p>

                    violence was not suggested to be interpreted, author only gave one reason of
                    practising warfare. In the beginning of the text some relics of humans' warfare
                    were intoduced, and the last sentence in this passage: "But not everyone agrees
                    that warfare is inbuilt" gives start for further discussion whether violence is
                    innate or not. <br></p></div>
