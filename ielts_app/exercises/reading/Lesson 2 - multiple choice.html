        <p>In this lesson we'll learn how to answer <strong>multiple choice questions</strong> on IELTS Reading. Multiple choice question asks you to choose the correct answer from 3 or 4 proposed answers. This type of question looks like this on the question paper: </p>
         <div class="exam-extract"><p>Choose the correct letter, <strong>A, B, C</strong> or <strong>D</strong>.</p>
			<p>Write the correct letter in boxes on your answer sheet. </p></div>
            <br><p><strong>Useful information about multiple choice questions</strong>: </p><ul>
        	<li>Questions follow the order of the text.</li>
            <li>Questions repeat key words (or their synonyms) from the text.</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
        <p>Multiple choice questions have 3 or 4 answers, only one of which is correct. Usually, there are such <strong>types of answers</strong>: </p><ol type="A">
          <li>Irrelevant answer that gives information, which is not stated in the text.</li>
          <li>Answer that gives completely opposite information.</li>
          <li>Answer that gives information that figures in the text, but not what you're asked about.</li>
          <li>Correct answer.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You should obviously choose the correct answer, not confusing it with other answers. To understand what I mean, see an <a href="#example">example below</a>.</p>
        	   <br>
          
       <p><strong>Answering strategy</strong>:
          </p><ol>
            <li>Read the first question and underline the <u>key words</u>.</li>
            <li>Read the text from the beginning, simultaneously scanning it for the information that relates to the question.</li>
            <li>Once you found the key words or their synonyms in the text - look for the answer (it should be somewhere close).</li>
            <li>One you've found the answer, read the next few lines of the text to make sure that it is correct. Also, reread the question.</li>
     
            <li>Repeat this strategy with other questions, but now read the text from the place where you stopped the last time.</li>
            <p>If you prefer another strategy, you can use it too. Remember: there is no 'right' strategy for answering IELTS Reading questions. In fact, you can try different answering strategies and figure out which one works the best for you.</p>
          </ol><p></p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Tips</strong>: </p><ul>
            <li>Scan text for the key words and their synonyms.</li>
            <li>Cross out the answers which are obviously wrong. This will help you to identify the correct answers more quickly.</li>
            <li>The order of questions can help you. Answer for question 4 will be between answers for questions 3 and 5 in the text.</li>
            <li>Don't rely on your own knowledge, the correct answer contains ONLY information stated in the text.</li></ul><p></p>

        <div class="exam-text"> 
        <h3 align="center">Rice That Fights Global Warming</h3><noindex>
          <p>More than half the global population relies on rice as a regular part of their diet. But rice paddies have a downside for the planet too: they produce as much as 17 percent of the world's total methane emissions. That is even more than coal mining emissions, which make 10 percent of total! So Christer Jansson, a plant biochemist at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, spent the past 10 years developing SUSIBA2, a genetically modified rice plant that emits almost no methane. </p> 
          </noindex>
          </div> <br>
          <p><strong>Multiple choice question:</strong></p>
          <p>1. What is the negative effect of rice?</p>
          <ol type="A">
          <li>It is regular part of more than half of the world population’s diet.          </li>
          <li>Rice paddies emit more methane than coal mining industry.</li>
          <li>Its plantations produce 17% of the world’s total methane emissions.</li>
          <li>Rice has genetically modified sort SUSIBA2, which is harmful for health.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>In this question key words are “<u><em>rice</em></u>” and “<u><em>negative effect</em></u>”.</p><br>
          <p>Now let's consider all the answers:</p>
          <p><strong>Answer A</strong> gives us true, but completely opposite information from  what we're looking for. The first sentence tells us that 
        </p><p class="text-extract">More than half the global population relies on rice as a regular part of their diet.</p>
        But it is a positive effect! And we're looking for the <u>negative</u> one. So this answer is false.
        <p></p><br>
        
        <p><strong>Answer B</strong> also gives us true information, but it is not what you’re asked about. Look at the third sentence, which contains information that answer B uses:
        </p><p class="text-extract">That is even more than coal mining emissions, which make 10 percent of total!</p>
This sentence is used only to highlight the negative effect, not to state it.<p></p>
<br>
<p><strong>Answer C is correct</strong>. The second sentence clearly states the negative effect:
</p><p class="text-extract">But rice paddies have a downside for the planet too: they produce as much as 17 percent of the world's total methane emissions.</p>
downside = negative effect<p></p>

<p>As you see, it's very important to search key words or their synonyms in the text.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Answer D</strong> is irrelevant: it was <em>not written</em> anywhere that SUSIBA2 is harmful. This answer uses some words from the text just to confuse you. </p>
<p><span style="color:red;">Don't be caught by irrelevant answers! If you see that answer contains information that contradicts the text or was not stated at all, it's an irrelevant answer.</span></p>
