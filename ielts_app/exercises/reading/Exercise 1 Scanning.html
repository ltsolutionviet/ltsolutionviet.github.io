        <p>In this exercise we'll <strong>improve your scanning technique for IELTS Reading</strong>. As
            you know, <u><em>scanning</em></u> means searching for specific phrases in the text to
            answer the questions.</p>
        <p>The best way to practice scanning is to search specific key words in the text to find answers
            for the questions. <strong>Scanning answering strategy</strong>: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Read the question.</li>
            <li>Detect the key words in the question.</li>
            <li>Scan the text for the key words to find the right answer.</li>
        </ol>
        <p></p>

        <p>Remember that <u>scanning is only one possible answering technique</u> and you shouldn't use
            it all the time! But still it's very convenient and is worth using.</p>

            <p align="center" style="font-weight:bold;"> From Panama to Sparta: A brief history of
                leaks </p>
            <p>&emsp; Say what you like about the recent spate of leaks, none have led to people having
                their testicles ritually crushed.

                Nor, as far as we know, has anyone been locked in a temple until they starved to death.
                Edward Snowden and Julian Assange are not universally popular, but even their most
                severe critics have not suggested that their actions provoked a military revolt, or
                caused politicians to be hauled from their debating chamber and strangled en masse. But
                all these horrors have taken place during the long and often violent history of leaking,
                with those exposed by leaks as well their perpetrators at times coming to a sticky
                end. </p>
            <p>&emsp; Take that fatal enforced malnourishment in a temple, for example. This happened in
                Sparta around 470BC as a directly result of leaked information.

                The leading general and one-time regent, Pausanias, sent one of his slaves with a
                message to the Persian King. Sensing that something was fishy about this, the slave,
                Argilios, opened the letter and found that Pausanias was offering to support the
                Persians if they invaded Greece. More than that, the general suggested that the Persians
                ought to kill the messenger delivering the letter, just to be sure of secrecy.</p>
            <p>&emsp; Understandably aggrieved at the one-way nature of his errand, Argilios decided to
                leak the letter to the Spartan authorities. Persia was the mortal enemy of Greece, so
                the general's actions were seen as nothing less than treachery - and so it was that he
                was bricked up in the Temple of Athena without any food by way of punishment. Records
                suggest that his own mother joined the angry citizens who made sure he could not escape.

                Ancient Greek politics was a relatively open affair, but Roman civilisation by contrast
                was positively ridden with plotting and intrigue in its later years, and a fair amount
                of leaking, according to the historian Tom Holland.</p>
            <p>&emsp; "There was an intense form of political combat, absolutely on the scale of ours
                today," he says. "You see leaks being used by would-be favourites to destroy their
                rivals."

                Perhaps the most famous leak of Roman times was the pile of documents which appeared on
                the doorstep of Cicero, Consul of the Roman Senate and a leading philosopher and orator
                of his time.</p>
            <p>&emsp; In 63BC, Cicero had become convinced that a senator called Catiline was plotting a
                coup, but was unable to prove it. What he found at his door was a collection of letters
                from allies of Catiline, outlining details of the plot. No-one ever discovered who had
                passed on this crucial evidence, but flourishing these letters on the floor of the
                Senate, Cicero was able to convince his colleagues once and for all that the Roman
                Republic was under threat. It was perhaps as a reward for his dedicated sleuthing, that
                Cicero was allowed to supervise personally the immediate execution by strangling of all
                the plotters. The Roman Empire endured for centuries, its eastern wing surviving as
                Byzantium right up until 1453 when it fell prey to the Ottomans. Theirs was a
                civilisation renowned for its tolerance - a multi-nation, multi-ethnic empire with a
                high degree of what might today be described as social mobility. Even a slave or a
                eunuch could rise up the hierarchy.</p>
            <p>&emsp; Yet, according to the writer Jason Goodwin, there was one area in which the
                Ottomans were famously severe. An expert on Ottoman affairs, Goodwin says they were
                obsessed with preserving secrecy. Many sultans employed deaf mutes around the court, he
                explains, so that they could not overhear, let alone propagate any information they
                might pick up.

                Sultan Osman the Second had more reason than most to fear leaks. He had decided to crack
                down on the elite military unit known as Janissaries, who he feared were becoming too
                powerful. Somehow though, this information did leak out - his own Vizier was later
                fingered as the source. </p>
            <p>&emsp; When the Janissaries were informed, they stormed Istanbul's Topkapi palace, and it
                was Osman who suffered the fate of having his testicles crushed before being put to
                death.

                Just as the Ottoman Empire was going into decline, the advent of the modern newspaper in
                the 19th Century was giving new breath to the fine art of leaking. Now there was the
                opportunity for leaked information to reach a vast audience, rather than being
                restricted to those directly affected.

                John Nugent of the New York Herald is credited with one of the first great scoops that
                came from a leak. In 1848, he was handed secret details of a treaty to end the war
                between the US and Mexico.</p>

            <p>&emsp; His decision to publish led to threats of imprisonment from outraged senators, who
                held him captive for almost a month. It might well have been worth it though, as Nugent
                was later promoted to the paper's editorship. Nugent set a precedent that persists to
                this day, according to Paul Lashmar, a lecturer in journalism at Sussex University, and
                a one-time investigative reporter himself. Reporters who get hold of leaks tend to be
                rewarded, he says, either with promotion, a pay rise or at least with extra professional
                kudos - even if they do sometimes face threats of imprisonment or worse along the way.

                "We would spend long hours in pubs cultivating sources," Lashmar says, rather wistfully.
                "It could be a police officer, a civil servant, or someone in the accounts department of
                a company… they passed an envelope over to you and that was great."</p>

            <p>&emsp; The advent of surveillance technology has made this kind of leak much rarer,
                Lashmar believes. Anyone with a mobile phone can have their movements traced, or they
                might be picked up on CCTV cameras. He has found public servants, in particular, far
                more wary of meeting journalists lest they be punished for their indiscretion.

                What has replaced the old-style brown envelope is the mass leak, the kind of vast
                treasure trove of data seen in the release of the Panama Papers, with millions of
                documents passed on in one go. It is new technology that has made this possible, of
                course. Earlier great leaks like the Pentagon Papers, which revealed secrets about US
                operations in Vietnam, had to be photocopied by hand, page after page. Now the entire
                records of a company or government department can be loaded on to a memory stick with
                just one click of a mouse.</p>

            <p>&emsp; The campaigning journalist, Heather Brooke, has handled plenty of leaks in her
                time, and believes this new kind of mass digital leak is here to stay.

                "It's very difficult to defend digital information, very easy to attack it," she says.

                Brooke argues that those who store digital information have themselves to blame if they
                find it ends up in the public domain.

                "We are in a time when everyone wants to keep every piece of data they can and keep it
                forever. They are creating a honeypot for hackers, for disgruntled employees, and for
                people who want to leak."

                We have come a long way from the days when a slave messenger could cause havoc in Sparta
                just by opening a letter. Yet the same asymmetry remains, indeed it is perhaps
                accentuated. Information is power, and in this early part of the 21st Century,
                information is also ubiquitous. From the US Army Private Chelsea Manning, to the
                intelligence contract worker, Edward Snowden, we have seen relatively low-ranking
                figures get their hands on information and then expose it, leaving those at the top
                deeply compromised.

                Now, more than ever, it seems, the leak is mightier than the sword.</p>
