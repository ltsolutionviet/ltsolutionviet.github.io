        <p align="center" style="font-weight:bold;"> 3D heart printed using multiple imaging
            techniques</p>
        <p>&emsp; Congenital heart experts from Spectrum Health Helen DeVos Children's Hospital have
            successfully integrated two common imaging techniques to produce a three-dimensional
            anatomic model of a patient's heart.</p>
        <p>&emsp; The 3D model printing of patients' hearts has become more common in recent years
            as part of an emerging, experimental field devoted to enhanced visualization of
            individual cardiac structures and characteristics. But this is the first time the
            integration of computed tomography (CT) and three-dimensional transesophageal
            echocardiography (3DTEE) has successfully been used for printing a hybrid 3D model of a
            patient's heart. A proof-of-concept study authored by the Spectrum Health experts also
            opens the way for these techniques to be used in combination with a third tool -
            magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p>

        <p>&emsp; "Hybrid 3D printing integrates the best aspects of two or more imaging modalities,
            which can potentially enhance diagnosis, as well as interventional and surgical
            planning," said Jordan Gosnell, Helen DeVos Children's Hospital cardiac sonographer, and
            lead author of the study. "Previous methods of 3D printing utilize only one imaging
            modality, which may not be as accurate as merging two or more datasets."</p>

        <p>&emsp; The team used specialized software to register images from the two imaging
            modalities to selectively integrate datasets to produce an accurate anatomic model of
            the heart. The result creates more detailed and anatomically accurate 3D renderings and
            printed models, which may enable physicians to better diagnose and treat heart
            disease.</p>

            <div id="hint1" style="display:none;"><p class="hint"> It is written in the first
                paragraph that experts "integrated two common imaging techniques to produce a

            <br>


            <li> Spectrum Health scientists have found a way to combine and use three techniques:
                computed tomography, three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography and

                about CT and 3DTEE, and then says that "study authored by the Spectrum Health

                third tool - <em>magnetic resonance imaging</em>". </p></div>

            <li> The new method of 3D printing is more efficient than previous methods because it

                advantages of a new method, ending with a sentence: "Previous methods of 3D printing
