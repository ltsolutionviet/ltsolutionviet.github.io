        <p>In this exercise you will train your IELTS Reading skills and develop answering techniques
            for <em><strong>classification questions in IELTS Reading</strong></em>. Just to remind you,
            in classification questions you're given some options (A, B, C etc.) and a list of
            statements. Your task is to read the text, and connect each statement to one option.</p>


        <p>Let's begin. <strong>Read the text and answer the questions below</strong>. Don't worry,
            we'll provide you with the correct answers and detailed explanations.</p>

            <p align="center" style="font-weight:bold;">Fluctuation of unemployment rate</p>

            <noindex>
                <p>During the recent downturn, the unemployment rate in America jumped from 4.4% to 10%.
                    Economic growth has since pepped up. But unemployment is nowhere near pre-crisis
                    lows: America’s rate, at 6.2%, is still 40% higher than late 2006. Economists are
                    raising the spectre of “structural” unemployment to explain this puzzle. What is
                    it?</p>
                <p>Economists often refer to three types of unemployment: "frictional", “cyclical” and
                    “structural”. Cold-hearted economists are not too worried about the first two, which
                    refer to people moving between jobs and those temporarily laid-off during a
                    downturn. </p>
                <p>Frictional unemployment exists because both jobs and workers are&nbsp;heterogeneous
                    (in other words, they have different expectations). And a mismatch can result
                    between the characteristics of supply and demand. Such a mismatch can be related to
                    skills, payment, worktime, location, attitude, taste, and a multitude of other
                    factors. New entrants (such as graduating students) and re-entrants (such as former
                    homemakers) can also suffer a spell of frictional unemployment. Workers as well as
                    employers accept a certain level of imperfection, risk or compromise, but usually
                    not right away; they will invest some time and effort to find a match. This is in
                    fact beneficial to the economy since it results in a better allocation of resources.
                    However, if the search takes too long and mismatches are too frequent, the economy
                    suffers, since some work will not get done. Therefore, governments seek ways to
                    reduce unnecessary frictional unemployment, and hopefully it’s not hard to do
                    so.</p>

                <p>The second type, cyclical unemployment deals with an economy's business cycle.
                    Cyclical unemployment occurs when there are job losses during downturns and
                    contractions in the business cycle. A lack of demand is one of the main factors that
                    cause cyclical unemployment. When there is a drop in consumer demand, business
                    revenues usually decline. Consequently, companies have to lay off workers to cut
                    their costs to maintain their profit margins.</p>
                <p>For example, the U.S. economy faced cyclical unemployment during the 2008 financial
                    crisis. As more and more subprime mortgage lenders filed for bankruptcy, homes were
                    not being constructed. Consequently, many people who were employed as construction
                    workers and home builders lost their jobs and experienced cyclical unemployment.</p>
                <p>The third kind refers to people who are excluded, perhaps permanently, from the
                    labour market. In econo-speak, structural unemployment refers to the mismatch
                    between the number of people looking for jobs and the number of jobs available. It
                    is bad news both for those who suffer from it and for the society in which they
                    live. People out of work for long periods tend to have poorer health than average.
                    The structurally unemployed also squeeze social-security budgets.</p>
                <p>Structural unemployment in advanced economies has been rising for decades, as jobs in
                    industries like mining and manufacturing have withered. In Britain between 1984 and
                    1992, employment in coal mining fell by 77% and in steelmaking by 72%. Communities
                    that were built around a single profession were devastated. Many of the people
                    affected only had experience of a specific, high-skill job. They did not have the
                    skills or attributes needed to be successful in many service-sector jobs (such as
                    working in a call centre or in a restaurant). Hence they were structurally
                    unemployed. A different problem may be afflicting advanced economies today. The
                    downturn was truly nasty and has lasted for years. Many people gave up looking for a
                    job and withdrew from the labour force. In America the number of these “discouraged
                    workers” jumped from 370,000 in 2007 to 1.2m in 2010. (Today it is twice its 2007
                    level.)
                    &nbsp;</p>
                <p>Most economists would accept that a certain level of unemployment is inevitable: an
                    attempt to achieve full employment would stoke massive wage inflation. Whatever its
                    causes, governments have to understand structural unemployment. Economic growth
                    alone will not be enough to get everyone into work. Supply-side reforms, such as job
                    training (known by wonks as “active labour market policies”) are also needed.</p>

        <h3>Questions 1-8</h3>
        <p style="font-weight:bold;">Classify the following statements as referring to:
        </p>
        <ol type="A">
            <li>frictional unemployment</li>
            <li>cyclical unemployment</li>
            <li>structural unemployment</li>
        </ol>
        <p></p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-weight:bold;">Write the appropriate letters A, B or C in boxes 1-8:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Mismatch between the number of people looking for jobs and the number of jobs available
                results in a long-term unemployment. <input type="text" class="ex-input" style="width:60px" id="ex1"
                    required="">
                <span id="s1"> </span>
                <button class="b2" id="buttonhint1" type="button" onclick="toggle('hint1')">Show hint
                </button>

                <div id="hint1" style="display:none;">
                    <p class="hint">The sixth paragraph says that
                        "<em>... structural unemployment refers to the mismatch between the number of people
                            looking for jobs and the number of jobs available.</em>". Thus, this statement
                        refers to <strong>structural unemployment</strong> (<strong>C</strong>).</p>
                </div>
            </li>

            <br>
            <li>In 2008 many Americans who were employed as construction workers lost their jobs. <input type="text"
                    class="ex-input" style="width:60px" id="ex2" required=""> <span id="s2"> </span>
                <button class="b2" id="buttonhint2" type="button" onclick="toggle('hint2')">Show hint
                </button>
                <div id="hint2" style="display:none;">
                    <p class="hint">It's easy to find the paragraph
                        that contains the answer by scanning the text for right key-words: 2008,
                        construction workers, America. The fifth paragraph says: "<em>... the U.S. economy
                            faced cyclical unemployment during the 2008 financial crisis. As more and more
                            subprime mortgage lenders filed for bankruptcy, homes were not being
                            constructed. Consequently, many people who were employed as construction workers
                            and home builders lost their jobs and experienced cyclical unemployment.</em>"
                        Thus, this statements refers to <strong>cyclical unemployment</strong>
                        (<strong>B</strong>).</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <br>


            <li>Downturns in the economy’s business cycle results in temporary job losses. <input type="text"
                    class="ex-input" style="width:60px" id="ex3" required=""> <span id="s3"> </span>
                <button class="b2" id="buttonhint3" type="button" onclick="toggle('hint3')">Show hint
                </button>
                <div id="hint3" style="display:none;">
                    <p class="hint">
                        Again, you can find the paragraph that contains the answer by scanning the text for
                        a key word: business cycle. This term is used in the fourth paragraph: "<em>Cyclical
                            unemployment occurs when there are job losses during downturns and contractions in
                            the business cycle.</em>" So the correct answer is <strong>cyclical
                            unemployment</strong> (<strong>B</strong>).</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <br>


            <li>It is not difficult to reduce this kind of unemployment. <input type="text" class="ex-input"
                    style="width:60px" id="ex4" required="">
                <span id="s4"> </span>

                </button>
                <div id="hint4" style="display:none;">
                    <p class="hint">
                        This statements refers to <strong>frictional unemployment</strong>
                        (<strong>A</strong>). The third paragraph says: "<em>... governments seek ways to
                            reduce unnecessary frictional unemployment, and hopefully it's not hard to do
                            so</em>."</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <br>


            <li>As jobs in industries like mining and manufacturing have withered, this type of
                unemployment has started to rise in advanced economies. <input type="text" class="ex-input"
                    style="width:60px" id="ex5" required="">
                <span id="s5"> </span>
                <button class="b2" id="buttonhint5" type="button" onclick="toggle('hint5')">Show hint
                </button>
                <div id="hint5" style="display:none;">
                    <p class="hint">
                        You can scan the text for the key words: <em>mining</em> and <em>manufacturing</em>,
                        and you'll find such phrase in the penultimate paragraph: "<em>Structural
                            unemployment in advanced economies has been rising for decades, as jobs in
                            industries like mining and manufacturing have withered.</em>". So the correct answer
                        is <strong>structural unemployment</strong> (<strong>C</strong>).</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <br>


            <li>Mismatch between the characteristics of supply and demand on job market results in this
                type of unemployment. <input type="text" class="ex-input" style="width:60px" id="ex6" required=""> <span
                    id="s6"> </span>
                <button class="b2" id="buttonhint6" type="button" onclick="toggle('hint6')">Show hint

                <div id="hint6" style="display:none;">
                    <p class="hint">
                        It is written in the third paragraph: "<em>Frictional unemployment exists because
                            both jobs and workers are heterogeneous (in other words, they have different
                            expectations). And a mismatch can result between the characteristics of supply and
                            demand.</em>". So the correct answer is <strong>frictional unemployment</strong>
                        (<strong>A</strong>).</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <br>


            <li>During the economy’s most massive downfalls, many people give up looking for a job and
                withdraw from the labour force. <input type="text" class="ex-input" style="width:60px" id="ex7"

                    <p class="hint">
                        The penultimate paragraph describes structural unemployments and contains such
                        phrase: "<em>Many people gave up looking for a job and withdrew from the labour
                            force.</em>". So this statements refers to <strong>structural unemployment</strong>
                        (<strong>C</strong>).</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <br>

            <li>To reduce this kind of unemployment, society needs supply-side reforms and job
                trainings. <input type="text" class="ex-input" style="width:60px" id="ex8" required="">

                    <p class="hint">
                        The last paragraph tells us that: "<em>... governments have to understand structural
