            <p>Glass, which has been made since the time of the Mesopotamians and Egyptians, is little more than a mixture of sand, soda ash and lime. When heated to about 1500 degrees Celsius (°C)&nbsp;this becomes a molten mass that hardens when slowly cooled. The first successful method&nbsp;for making clear, flat glass involved <span class="explainq1 explain">spinning</span>. This method was very effective as the glass&nbsp;had not touched any surfaces between being soft and becoming hard, so it stayed perfectly&nbsp;<span class="explainq2 explain">unblemished</span>, with a 'fire finish'. However, the process took a long time and was <span class="explainq3 explain">labour&nbsp;intensive</span>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, demand for flat glass was very high and glassmakers across the world were looking for a method of making it continuously. The first continuous ribbon process involved&nbsp;squeezing molten glass through two hot rollers, similar to an old mangle. This allowed glass of&nbsp;virtually any <span class="explainq4 explain">thickness</span> to be made non-stop, but the <span class="explainq8 explain">rollers</span> would leave both sides of the glass&nbsp;<span class="explainq5 explain">marked</span>, and these would then need to be ground and polished. This part of the process rubbed&nbsp;away around 20 per cent of the glass, and the machines were very expensive.</p>
<p>The float process for making flat glass was invented by Alistair Pilkington. This process allows the manufacture of clear, tinted and coated glass for buildings, and clear and tinted&nbsp;glass for vehicles. Pilkington had been experimenting with improving the melting process,&nbsp;and in 1952 he had the idea of using a bed of molten metal to form the flat glass, eliminating&nbsp;altogether the need for rollers within the float bath. <span class="explainq9 explain">The metal had to melt at a temperature&nbsp;less than the hardening point of glass (about 600°C), but could not boil at a temperature&nbsp;below the temperature of the molten glass (about 1500°C)</span>. The best metal for the job was&nbsp;<span class="explainq7 explain">tin</span>.</p>
<p>The rest of the concept relied on gravity, which guaranteed that the surface of the molten metal was perfectly flat and horizontal. Consequently, when pouring <span class="explainq6 explain">molten glass</span> onto the&nbsp;molten tin, the underside of the glass would also be perfectly flat. If the glass were kept hot&nbsp;enough, it would flow over the molten tin until the top surface was also flat, horizontal and&nbsp;perfectly parallel to the bottom surface. Once the glass cooled to 604°C or less it was too&nbsp;hard to mark and could be transported out of the cooling zone by rollers. The glass settled to&nbsp;a thickness of six millimetres because of surface tension interactions between the glass and&nbsp;the tin. By fortunate coincidence, 60 per cent of the flat glass market at that time was for six-millimetre glass.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pilkington built a pilot plant in 1953 and by 1955 he had convinced his company to build a full-scale plant. However,<span class="explainq10 explain explainq11"> it took 14 months of non-stop production, costing the company&nbsp;£100,000 a month, before the plant produced any usable glass</span>. Furthermore, once they&nbsp;succeeded in making marketable flat glass, the machine was turned off for a service to prepare&nbsp;it for years of continuous production. When it started up again it took another four months to&nbsp;get the process right again. They finally succeeded in 1959 and there are now float plants all&nbsp;over the world, with each able to produce around 1000 tons of glass every day, non-stop for&nbsp;around 15 years.</p>
<p>Float plants today make glass of near optical quality. Several processes - melting, refining, homogenising - take place simultaneously in the 2000 tonnes of molten glass in the furnace.&nbsp;They occur in separate zones in a complex glass flow driven by high temperatures. It adds up&nbsp;to a continuous melting process, lasting as long as 50 hours, that delivers glass smoothly and&nbsp;continuously to the float bath, and from there to a coating zone and finally a heat treatment&nbsp;zone, where stresses formed during cooling are relieved.</p>
<p>The principle of float glass is unchanged since the 1950s. However, <span class="explainq12 explain">the product has changed dramatically, from a single thickness of 6.8 mm to a range from sub-millimetre to 25 mm,&nbsp;from a ribbon frequently marred by inclusions and bubbles to almost optical perfection</span>. To&nbsp;ensure the highest quality, inspection takes place at every stage. Occasionally, a bubble is not&nbsp;removed during refining, a sand grain refuses to melt, a tremor in the tin puts ripples into&nbsp;the glass ribbon. Automated on-line inspection does two things. Firstly, it reveals process&nbsp;faults upstream that can be corrected. <span class="explainq13 explain">Inspection technology allows more than 100 million&nbsp;measurements a second to be made across the ribbon, locating flaws the unaided eye would be&nbsp;unable to see</span>. Secondly, it enables computers downstream to steer cutters around flaws.</p>
<p>Float glass is sold by the square metre, and at the final stage computers translate customer requirements into patterns of cuts designed to minimise waste.</p>
