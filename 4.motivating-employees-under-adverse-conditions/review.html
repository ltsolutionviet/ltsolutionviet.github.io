            <p><strong>THE CHALLENGE</strong></p>
<p>It is a great deal easier to motivate employees in a growing organisation than a declining one. When organisations are expanding and adding personnel, promotional opportunities,&nbsp;pay rises, and the excitement of being associated with a dynamic organisation create&nbsp;feelings of optimism. Management is able to use the growth to entice and encourage&nbsp;employees. <span class=" explain">When an organisation is shrinking, the best and most mobile workers are prone&nbsp;to leave voluntarily. Unfortunately, they are the ones the organisation can least afford to lose&nbsp;- those with the highest skills and experience. The minor employees remain because their job&nbsp;options are limited</span>.</p>
<p>Morale also suffers during decline. People fear they may be the next to be made redundant. Productivity often suffers, as employees spend their time sharing rumours and&nbsp;providing one another with moral support rather than focusing on their jobs. For those whose&nbsp;jobs are secure, pay increases are rarely possible. Pay cuts, unheard of during times of&nbsp;growth, may even be imposed. The challenge to management is how to motivate employees&nbsp;under such retrenchment conditions. The ways of meeting this challenge can be broadly&nbsp;divided into six Key Points, which are outlined below.</p>
<p><strong>KEY POINT ONE</strong></p>
<p>There is an abundance of evidence to support the motivational benefits that result from carefully matching people to jobs. For example, if the job is running a small business or an&nbsp;autonomous unit within a larger business, high achievers should be sought. However, if the&nbsp;ob to be filled is a managerial post in a large bureaucratic organisation, a candidate who&nbsp;has a high need for power and a low need for affiliation should be selected. Accordingly,&nbsp;high achievers should not be put into jobs that are inconsistent with their needs. <span class=" explain">High&nbsp;achievers will do best when the job provides moderately challenging goals and where there&nbsp;is independence and feedback</span>. However, it should be remembered that not everybody is&nbsp;motivated by jobs that are high in independence, variety and responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>KEY POINT TWO</strong></p>
<p><span class=" explain">The literature on goal-setting theory suggests that managers should ensure that all employees have specific goals and receive comments on how well they are doing in those goals</span>. For&nbsp;those with high achievement needs, typically a minority in any organisation, <span class=" explain">the existence of&nbsp;external goals is less important because high achievers are already internally motivated</span>. The&nbsp;next factor to be determined is whether the goals should be assigned by a manager or&nbsp;collectively set in conjunction with the employees. The answer to that depends on perceptions&nbsp;of goal acceptance and the organisation's culture. If resistance to goals is expected, the use&nbsp;of participation in goal-setting should increase acceptance. If participation is inconsistent with&nbsp;the culture, however, goals should be assigned. <span class=" explain">If participation and the culture are incongruous, employees are likely to perceive the participation process as manipulative and&nbsp;be negatively affected by it</span>.</p>
<p><strong>KEY POINT THREE</strong></p>
<p>Regardless of whether goals are achievable or well within management's perceptions of the employee's ability, if employees see them as unachievable they will reduce their effort.&nbsp;Managers must be sure, therefore, that employees feel confident that their efforts can lead to&nbsp;performance goals. <span class=" explain">For managers, this means that employees must have the capability of&nbsp;doing the job and must regard the appraisal process as valid</span>.</p>
<p><strong>KEY POINT FOUR</strong></p>
<p>Since employees have different needs, what acts as a reinforcement for one may not for another. <span class=" explain">Managers could use their knowledge of each employee to personalise the rewards&nbsp;over which they have control</span>. Some of the more obvious rewards that managers allocate&nbsp;include pay, promotions, autonomy, job scope and depth, and the opportunity to participate&nbsp;in goal-setting and decision-making.</p>
<p><strong>KEY POINT FIVE</strong></p>
<p><span class=" explain">Managers need to make rewards contingent on performance</span>. To reward factors other than performance will only reinforce those other factors. Key rewards such as pay increases and&nbsp;promotions or advancements should be allocated for the attainment of the employee's specific&nbsp;goals. Consistent with maximising the impact of rewards, managers should look for ways to&nbsp;increase their visibility. Eliminating the secrecy surrounding pay oy openly communicating&nbsp;everyone's remuneration, publicising performance bonuses and allocating annual salary&nbsp;increases in a lump sum rather than spreading them out over an entire year are examples of&nbsp;actions that will make rewards more visible and potentially more motivating.</p>
<p><strong>KEY POINT SIX</strong></p>
<p><span class=" explain"><span class=" explain">The way rewards are distributed should be transparent so that employees perceive that rewards or outcomes are equitable and equal to the inputs given</span></span>. On a simplistic level,&nbsp;experience, abilities, effort and other obvious inputs should explain differences in pay,&nbsp;responsibility and other obvious outcomes. The problem, however, is complicated by the&nbsp;existence of dozens of inputs and outcomes and by the fact that employee groups place&nbsp;different degrees of importance on them. For instance, a study comparing clerical and&nbsp;production workers identified nearly twenty inputs and outcomes, <span class=" explain">the&nbsp;clerical workers&nbsp;considered factors such as quality of work performed and job knowledge near the top of&nbsp;their list</span>, but these were at the bottom of the production workers' list. Similarly, production&nbsp;workers thought that the most important inputs were intelligence and personal involvement&nbsp;with task accomplishment, two factors that were quite low in the importance ratings of the&nbsp;clerks. There were also important, though less dramatic, differences on the outcome side. <span class=" explain">For&nbsp;example, production workers rated advancement very highly</span>, whereas clerical workers rated&nbsp;advancement in the lower third of their list. Such findings suggest that one person's equity is&nbsp;another's inequity, so an ideal should probably weigh different inputs and outcomes&nbsp;according to employee group.</p>
