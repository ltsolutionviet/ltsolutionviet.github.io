            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A whale surprises researchers with her journey.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lone humpback whale travelled more than 9,800 kilometres from breeding areas in Brazil to those in Madagascar, setting a record for the longest mammal migration ever documented.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humpback whales (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Megaptera novaeangliae)&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are known to have some of the longest migration distances of all mammals, and this huge journey is about 400 kilometres farther than the previous humpback record. The finding was made by Peter Stevick, a biologist at the College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, Maine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The whale’s journey was unusual not only for its length, but also because it travelled across almost 90 degrees of longitude from west to east. Typically, humpbacks move in a north-south <span class="explainq23 explain">direction</span> between cold feeding areas and warm breeding grounds - and <span class="explainq24 explain">the longest journeys</span> which have been recorded until now have been between breeding and feeding sites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The whale, a female, was first spotted off the coast of Brazil, where researchers <span class="explainq26 explain">photographed</span> its tail fluke and<span class="explainq25 explain"> took skin samples</span> for chromosome testing to determine the animal's sex. Two years later, a tourist on a whale-watching boat snapped a photo of the humpback near Madagascar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To match the two sightings, Stevick’s team used an extensive international catalogue of photographs of the undersides of tail flukes, which have distinctive markings. Researchers routinely<span class="explainq33 explain"> compare the markings in each new photograph to those in the archive</span>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scientists then estimated the animal’s shortest possible route: an arc skirting the southern tip of <span class="explainq28 explain">South Africa</span> and heading north-east towards Madagascar. The minimum distance&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is 9,800 kilometres, says Stevick, but this is likely to be an underestimate, because the whale probably took a detour to feed on krill in the Southern Ocean near <span class="explainq27 explain">Antarctica</span> before reaching its destination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most humpback-whale researchers focus their efforts on the Northern Hemisphere because the Southern Ocean near the Antarctic is a <span class="explainq29 explain">hostile environment</span> and it is hard to get to, explains Rochelle Constantine, who studies the ecology of humpback whales at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. But, for whales, oceans in the Southern Hemisphere are wider and <span class="explainq30 explain">easier to travel across</span>, says Constantine. Scientists will probably observe more long-distance migrations in the Southern Hemisphere as <span class="explainq34 explain">satellite tracking becomes increasingly common</span>, she adds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daniel Palacios, an oceanographer at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, says that the record-breaking journey could indicate that migration patterns are shifting as populations begin to recover from near-extinction and the population increases. But the reasons why the whale did not follow the usual migration routes remain a mystery. She could have been <span class="explainq32 explain">exploring new habitats</span>, or simply <span class="explainq31 explain">have lost her way</span>. 'We generally think of humpback whales as very well studied, but then they surprise us with things like this,’ Palacios says. ‘Undoubtedly there are a lot of things we still don’t know about whale migration.’</span></p>
