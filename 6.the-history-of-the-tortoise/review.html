            <p>If you go back far enough, everything lived in the sea. At various points in evolutionary&nbsp;history, enterprising individuals within&nbsp;many different animal groups moved out&nbsp;onto the land, sometimes even to the&nbsp;most parched deserts, taking their own&nbsp;private seawater with them in blood and&nbsp;cellular fluids. In addition to the reptiles,&nbsp;birds, mammals and insects which we&nbsp;see all around us, other groups that have&nbsp;succeeded out of water include scorpions,&nbsp;snails, crustaceans such as woodlice and&nbsp;land crabs, millipedes and centipedes,&nbsp;spiders and various worms. And we&nbsp;mustn’t forget the <span class="explainq1 explain">plants</span>, without whose&nbsp;prior invasion of the land none of the other&nbsp;migrations could have happened.</p>
<p>Moving from water to land involved a major redesign of every aspect of life,&nbsp;including <span class="explainq2 explain">breathing and reproduction</span>.&nbsp;Nevertheless, a good number of&nbsp;thoroughgoing land animals later turned&nbsp;around, abandoned their hard-earned&nbsp;terrestrial re-tooling, and returned to&nbsp;the water again. Seals have only gone&nbsp;part way back. They show us what the&nbsp;intermediates might have been like, on&nbsp;the way to extreme cases such as whales&nbsp;and dugongs. Whales (including the small&nbsp;whales we call dolphins) and dugongs,&nbsp;with their close cousins the manatees,&nbsp;ceased to be land creatures altogether&nbsp;and reverted to the full marine habits of</p>
<p>their remote ancestors. They don’t even come ashore to breed. They do, however,&nbsp;still breathe air, having never developed&nbsp;anything equivalent to the <span class="explainq3 explain">gills</span> of their&nbsp;earlier marine incarnation. Turtles went&nbsp;back to the sea a very long time ago and,&nbsp;like all vertebrate returnees to the water,&nbsp;they breathe air. However, they are, in one&nbsp;respect, less fully given back to the water&nbsp;than whales or dugongs, for turtles still lay&nbsp;their eggs on beaches.</p>
<p>There is evidence that all modem turtles are descended from a terrestrial&nbsp;ancestor which lived before most of the&nbsp;dinosaurs. There are two key fossils&nbsp;called Proganochelys quenstedti and&nbsp;Palaeochersis talampayensis dating&nbsp;from early dinosaur times, which appear&nbsp;to be close to the ancestry of all modem&nbsp;turtles and tortoises. <span class="explainq6 explain">You might wonder&nbsp;how we can tell whether fossil animals&nbsp;lived on land or in water, especially if&nbsp;only fragments are found</span>. Sometimes&nbsp;it’s obvious. Ichthyosaurs were reptilian&nbsp;contemporaries of the dinosaurs, with fins&nbsp;and streamlined bodies. <span class="explainq7 explain">The fossils look&nbsp;like</span> <span class="explainq4 explain">dolphins</span> and they surely lived like&nbsp;dolphins, in the water. With turtles it is a&nbsp;little less obvious. One way to tell is by&nbsp;measuring the bones of their forelimbs.</p>
<p>Walter Joyce and Jacques Gauthier, at Yale University, obtained <span class="explainq8 explain">three&nbsp;measurements</span> in these particular bones of 71 species of living turtles and tortoises. They used a kind of <span class="explainq9 explain">triangular graph</span> paper&nbsp;to plot the three measurements against&nbsp;one another. All the land tortoise species&nbsp;formed a tight <span class="explainq10 explain">cluster</span> of points in the upper&nbsp;part of the triangle; all the water turtles&nbsp;cluster in the lower part of the triangular&nbsp;graph. There was no overlap, except when&nbsp;they added some species that spend time&nbsp;both in water and on land. Sure enough,&nbsp;these <span class="explainq11 explain">amphibious</span> species show up on the&nbsp;triangular graph approximately <span class="explainq12 explain">half way</span>&nbsp;between the ‘wet cluster’ of sea turtles and&nbsp;the ‘dry cluster’ of land tortoises. The next&nbsp;step was to determine where the fossils&nbsp;fell. The bones of P quenstedti and JR&nbsp;talampayensis leave us in no doubt. Their&nbsp;points on the graph are right in the thick&nbsp;of the dry cluster. Both these fossils were&nbsp;<span class="explainq13 explain">dry-land tortoises</span>. They come from the era&nbsp;before our turtles returned to the water.</p>
<p>You might think, therefore, that modem land tortoises have probably stayed on&nbsp;land ever since those early terrestrial&nbsp;times, as most mammals did after a few of&nbsp;them went back to the sea. But apparently not. If you draw out the family tree of all modem turtles and tortoises, nearly&nbsp;all the branches are aquatic. Today’s&nbsp;land tortoises constitute a single branch,&nbsp;deeply nested among branches consisting&nbsp;of aquatic turtles. This suggests that&nbsp;modem land tortoises have not stayed&nbsp;on land continuously since the time of P.&nbsp;quenstedti and P talampayensis. Rather,&nbsp;their ancestors were among those who&nbsp;went back to the water, and they then re-emerged back onto the land in (relatively)&nbsp;more recent times.</p>
<p>Tortoises therefore represent a remarkable double return. In common&nbsp;with all mammals, reptiles and birds, their&nbsp;remote ancestors were marine fish and&nbsp;before that various more or less worm-like&nbsp;creatures stretching back, still in the sea, to&nbsp;the primeval bacteria. Later ancestors lived&nbsp;on land and stayed there for a very large&nbsp;number of generations. Later ancestors still&nbsp;evolved back into the water and became&nbsp;sea turtles. And finally they returned yet&nbsp;again to the land as tortoises, some of&nbsp;which now live in the driest of deserts.</p>
