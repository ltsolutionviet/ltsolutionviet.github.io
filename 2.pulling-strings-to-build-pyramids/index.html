                <h2>Pulling strings to build pyramids</h2>

            </div>
            <p><br><em>No one knows exactly how the pyramids were built. Marcus Chown reckons the answer could be 'hanging&nbsp;in the air'.</em></p>
<p>The pyramids of Egypt were built more than three thousand years ago, and no one knows how. The&nbsp;conventional picture is that tens of thousands of slaves&nbsp;dragged stones on sledges. But there is no evidence to&nbsp;back this up. Now a Californian software consultant&nbsp;called Maureen Clemmons has suggested that kites&nbsp;might have been involved. While perusing a book on&nbsp;the monuments of Egypt, she noticed a hieroglyph that showed a row of men standing in&nbsp;odd postures. They were holding what looked like ropes that led, via some kina of&nbsp;mechanical system, to a giant bird in the sky. She wondered if perhaps the bird was&nbsp;actually a giant kite, and the men were using it to lift a heavy object.</p>
<p>Intrigued, Clemmons contacted Morteza Gharib, aeronautics professor at the California Institute of Technology. He was fascinated by the idea. 'Coming from Iran, I have a keen&nbsp;interest in Middle Eastern science/ he says. He too was puzzled by the picture that had&nbsp;sparked Clemmons's interest. The object in the sky apparently had wings far too short and&nbsp;wide for a bird. The possibility certainly existed that it was a kite/ he says. And since he&nbsp;needed a summer project for his student Emilio Graff, investigating the possibility of using&nbsp;kites as heavy lifters seemed like a good idea.</p>
<p>Gharib and Graff set themselves the task of raising a 4.5-metre stone column from horizontal to vertical, using no source of energy except the wind. Their initial calculations&nbsp;and scale-model wind-tunnel experiments convinced them they wouldn't need a strong&nbsp;wind to lift the 33.5-tonne column. Even a modest force, if sustained over a long time,&nbsp;would do. The key was to use a pulley system that would magnify the applied force. So&nbsp;they rigged up a tent-shaped scaffold directly above the tip of the horizontal column, with&nbsp;pulleys suspended from the scaffold's apex. The idea was that as one end of the column&nbsp;rose, the base would roll across the ground on a trolley.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the team put Clemmons's unlikely theory to the test, using a 40-square-metre rectangular nylon sail. The kite lifted the column clean off the ground. 'We were absolutely stunned,' Gharib says. The instant the sail opened into the wind, a huge force&nbsp;was generated and the column was raised to the vertical in a mere 40 seconds.'</p>
<p>The wind was blowing at a gentle 16 to 20 kilometres an hour, little more than half what they thought would be needed. What they had failed to reckon with was what happened&nbsp;when the kite was opened. There was a huge initial force - five times larger than the steady&nbsp;state force,' Gharib says. This jerk meant that kites could lift huge weights, Gharib realised.&nbsp;Even a 300-tonne column could have been lifted to the vertical with 40 or so men and four&nbsp;or five sails. So Clemmons was right: the pyramid, builders could have used kites to lift&nbsp;massive stones into place. 'Whether they actually did is another matter,' Gharib says. There&nbsp;are no pictures showing the construction of the pyramids, so there is no way to tell what&nbsp;really happened. The evidence for using kites to move large stones is no better or worse&nbsp;than the evidence for the brute force method,' Gharib says.</p>
<p>Indeed, the experiments have left many specialists unconvinced. The evidence for kitelifting is non-existent,' says Willeke Wendrich, an associate professor of Egyptology at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Others feel there is more of a case for the theory. Harnessing the wind would not have been a problem for accomplished sailors like the Egyptians. And they are known to have&nbsp;used wooden pulleys, which could have been made strong enough to bear the weight of&nbsp;massive blocks of stone. In addition, there is some physical evidence that the ancient&nbsp;Egyptians were interested in flight. A wooden artefact found on the step pyramid at&nbsp;Saqqara looks uncannily like a modern glider. Although it dates from several hundred&nbsp;years after the building of the pyramids, its sophistication suggests that the Egyptians might&nbsp;nave been developing ideas of flight for a long time. And other ancient civilisations&nbsp;certainly knew about kites; as early as 1250 BC, the Chinese were using them to deliver&nbsp;messages and dump flaming debris on their foes.</p>
<p>The experiments might even have practical uses nowadays. There are plenty of places around the globe where people have no access to heavy machinery, but do know how to&nbsp;deal with wind, sailing and basic mechanical principles. Gharib has already been&nbsp;contacted by a civil engineer in Nicaragua, who wants to put up buildings with adobe&nbsp;roofs supported by concrete arches on a site that heavy equipment can't reach. His idea&nbsp;is to build the arcnes horizontally, then lift them into place using kites. 'We've given him&nbsp;some design hints,' says Gharib. We're just waiting for him to report back.' So whether&nbsp;they were actually used to build the pyramids or not, it seems that kites may make sensible&nbsp;construction tools in the 21 st century AD.</p>
