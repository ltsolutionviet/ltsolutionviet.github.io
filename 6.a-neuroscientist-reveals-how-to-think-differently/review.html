            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>In the last decade a revolution has occurred In the way that scientists think about the brain.</em></strong></p>
<p>We now know that the decisions humans make can be traced to the firing patterns of neurons in specific parts of the brain. <span class="explainq1 explain">These discoveries have led to the field known as <strong>neuroeconomics</strong>,&nbsp;which studies the brain's secrets to success in an economic environment that demands&nbsp;innovation and being able to do things differently from competitors</span>. A brain that can do this is&nbsp;an iconoclastic one. Briefly, an iconoclast is a person who does something that others say can't&nbsp;be done.</p>
<p>This definition implies that iconoclasts are different from other people, but more precisely, <span class="explainq2 explain">it is their brains that are different</span> in three distinct ways: perception, fear response, and social&nbsp;intelligence. Each of these three functions utilizes a different circuit in the brain. Naysayers&nbsp;might suggest that the brain is irrelevant, that thinking in an original, even revolutionary,&nbsp;way is more a matter of personality than brain function. But the field of neuroeconomics was&nbsp;born out of the realization that the physical workings of the brain place limitations on the way&nbsp;we make decisions. By understanding these constraints, we begin to understand why some&nbsp;people march to a different drumbeat.</p>
<p>The first thing to realize is that the brain suffers from limited resources. It has a fixed energy budget, about the same as a 40 watt light bulb, so it has evolved to work as efficiently as&nbsp;possible. This is where most people are impeded from being an iconoclast. For example, when&nbsp;confronted with information streaming from the eyes, the brain will interpret this information&nbsp;in the quickest way possible. Thus<span class="explainq3 explain"> it will draw on both past experience</span> and any other source&nbsp;of information, such as what other people say, to make sense of what it is seeing. This happens&nbsp;all the time. The brain takes shortcuts that work so well we are hardly ever aware of them.</p>
<p>We think our perceptions of the world are real, but they are only biological and electrical rumblings. Perception is not simply a product of what your eyes or ears transmit to your brain.&nbsp;More than the physical reality of photons or sound waves, <span class="explainq4 explain">perception is a product of the brain</span>.</p>
<p>Perception is central to iconoclasm. Iconoclasts see things differently to other people. <span class="explainq5 explain">Their brains do not fall into efficiency pitfalls</span> as much as the average person's brain. Iconoclasts, either&nbsp;because they were born that way or through learning, have found ways to work around the&nbsp;perceptual shortcuts that plague most people. Perception is not something that is hardwired&nbsp;into the brain. It is a learned process, which is both a curse and an opportunity for change. The brain faces the fundamental problem of interpreting physical stimuli from the senses. Everything&nbsp;the brain sees, hears, or touches has multiple interpretations. The one that is ultimately chosen&nbsp;is simply the brain's best theory. In technical terms, these conjectures have their basis in the&nbsp;statistical likelihood of one interpretation over another and are heavily influenced by past&nbsp;experience and, importantly for potential iconoclasts, what other people say.</p>
<p>The best way to see things differently to other people is to bombard the brain with things it has never encountered before. <span class="explainq6 explain">Novelty releases the perceptual process from the chains&nbsp;of past experience and forces the brain to make new judgments</span>. <span class="explainq7 explain">Successful iconoclasts&nbsp;have an extraordinary willingness to be exposed to what is fresh and different.</span> Observation&nbsp;of iconoclasts shows that they embrace novelty while most people avoid things that are&nbsp;different.</p>
<p>The problem with novelty, however, is that it tends to trigger the brain's fear system. Fear is a major impediment to thinking like an iconoclast and stops the average person in his&nbsp;tracks. There are many types of fear, but the two that inhibit iconoclastic thinking and people&nbsp;generally find difficult to deal with are fear of uncertainty and fear of public ridicule. These may&nbsp;seem like trivial phobias. <span class="explainq11 explain">But fear of public speaking, which everyone must do from time to&nbsp;time, afflicts one-third of the population. This makes it too common to be considered a mental&nbsp;disorder</span>. <span class="explainq9 explain">It is simply a common variant of human nature, one which iconoclasts do not let&nbsp;inhibit their reactions</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, to be successful iconoclasts, individuals must sell their ideas to other people. This is where social intelligence comes in. Social intelligence is the ability to understand and&nbsp;manage people in a business setting. <span class="explainq13 explain">In the last decade there has been an explosion of&nbsp;knowledge about the social brain and how the brain works when groups coordinate decision&nbsp;making</span>. Neuroscience has revealed which brain circuits are responsible for functions like&nbsp;understanding what other people think, empathy, fairness, and social identity. These brain&nbsp;regions play key roles in whether people convince others of their ideas. Perception is&nbsp;important in social cognition too. The perception of someone's enthusiasm, or reputation,&nbsp;can make or break a deal. <span class="explainq12 explain">Understanding how perception becomes intertwined with social&nbsp;decision making shows why successful iconoclasts are so rare.</span></p>
<p><span class="explainq14 explain">Iconoclasts create new opportunities in every area from artistic expression to technology to business. They supply creativity and innovation not easily accomplished by committees</span>. Rules&nbsp;aren't important to them. <span class="explainq14 explain">Iconoclasts face alienation and failure, but can also be a major asset&nbsp;to any organization</span>. It is crucial for success in any field to understand how the iconoclastic&nbsp;mind works.</p>
