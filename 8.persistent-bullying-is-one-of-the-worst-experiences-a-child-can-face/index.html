            </div>
            <p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>How can it be prevented? Peter Smith, Professor of Psychology at the University of Sheffield, directed the Sheffield Anti-Bullying Intervention Project, funded by the Department for Education</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Here he reports on his findings.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>A </strong></p>
<p>Bullying can take a variety of forms, from the verbal - being taunted or called hurtful names - to the physical - being kicked or shoved - as well as indirect forms, such as&nbsp;being excluded from social groups. A survey I conducted with Irene Whitney found&nbsp;that in British primary schools up to a quarter of pupils reported experience of&nbsp;bullying, which in about one in ten cases was persistent. There was less bullying in&nbsp;secondary schools, with about one in twenty-five suffering persistent bullying, but&nbsp;these cases may be particularly recalcitrant.</p>
<p><strong>B </strong></p>
<p>Bullying is clearly unpleasant, and can make the child experiencing it feel unworthy and depressed. In extreme cases it can even lead to suicide, though this is thankfully&nbsp;rare. Victimised pupils are more likely to experience difficulties with interpersonal&nbsp;relationships as adults, while children who persistently bully are more likely to grow&nbsp;up to be physically violent, and convicted of anti-social offences.</p>
<p><strong>C </strong></p>
<p>Until recently, not much was known about the topic, and little help was available to teachers to deal with bullying. Perhaps as a consequence, schools would often deny&nbsp;the problem. ‘There is no bullying at this school’ has been a common refrain, almost&nbsp;certainly untrue. Fortunately more schools are now saying: There is not much&nbsp;bullying here, but when it occurs we have a clear policy for dealing with it.’</p>
<p><strong>D</strong></p>
<p>Three factors are involved in this change. First is an awareness of the severity of the problem. Second, a number of resources to help tackle bullying have become&nbsp;available in Britain. For example, the Scottish Council for Research in Education&nbsp;produced a package of materials, Action Against Bullying, circulated to all schools in&nbsp;England and Wales as well as in Scotland in summer 1992, with a second pack,&nbsp;Supporting Schools Against Bullying, produced the following year. In Ireland, Guidelines&nbsp;on Countering Bullying Behaviour in Post-Primary Schools was published in 1993. Third,&nbsp;there is evidence that these materials work, and that schools can achieve something.&nbsp;This comes from carefully conducted ‘before and after’ evaluations of interventions&nbsp;in schools, monitored by a research team. In Norway, after an intervention campaign&nbsp;was introduced nationally, an evaluation of forty-two schools suggested that, over a&nbsp;two-year period, bullying was halved. The Sheffield investigation, which involved&nbsp;sixteen primary schools and seven secondary schools, found that most schools&nbsp;succeeded in reducing bullying.</p>
<p><strong>E </strong></p>
<p>Evidence suggests that a key step is to develop a policy on bullying, saying clearly what is meant by bullying, and giving explicit guidelines on what will be done if it&nbsp;occurs, what records will be kept, who will be informed, what sanctions will be&nbsp;employed. The policy should be developed through consultation, over a period of&nbsp;time - not just imposed from the head teacher’s office! Pupils, parents and staff&nbsp;should feel they have been involved in the policy, which needs to be disseminated and&nbsp;implemented effectively.</p>
<p>Other actions can be taken to back up the policy. There are ways of dealing with the topic through the curriculum, using video, drama and literature. These are useful&nbsp;for raising awareness, and can best be tied in to early phases of development, while&nbsp;the school is starting to discuss the issue of bullying. They are also useful in renewing&nbsp;the policy for new pupils, or revising it in the light of experience. But curriculum&nbsp;work alone may only have short-term effects; it should be an addition to policy work,&nbsp;not a substitute.</p>
<p>There are also ways of working with individual pupils, or in small groups. Assertiveness training for pupils who are liable to be victims is worthwhile, and&nbsp;certain approaches to group bullying such as 'no blame’, can be useful in changing the&nbsp;behaviour of bullying pupils without confronting them directly, although other&nbsp;sanctions may be needed for those who continue with persistent bullying.</p>
<p>Work in the playground is important, too. One helpful step is to train lunchtime supervisors to distinguish bullying from playful fighting, and help them break up&nbsp;conflicts. Another possibility is to improve the playground environment, so that&nbsp;pupils are less likely to be led into bullying from boredom or frustration.</p>
<p><strong>F </strong></p>
<p>With these developments, schools can expect that at least the most serious kinds of bullying can largely be prevented. The more effort put in and the wider the whole&nbsp;school involvement, the more substantial the results are likely to be. The reduction&nbsp;in bullying - and the consequent improvement in pupil happiness - is surely a&nbsp;worthwhile objective.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>B</b> <input type="radio" name="q5" value="B" onclick="grd(this)"> there was less bullying than in primary schools.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>C</b> <input type="radio" name="q5" value="C" onclick="grd(this)"> cases of persistent bullying were very common.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>D</b> <input type="radio" name="q5" value="D" onclick="grd(this)"> indirect forms of bullying were particularly difficult to deal with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Children who are bullied</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>A</b> <input type="radio" name="q6" value="A" onclick="grd(this)"> are twice as likely to commit suicide as the average person.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>C</b> <input type="radio" name="q6" value="C" onclick="grd(this)"> are less likely to be violent in later life.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>C</b> <input type="radio" name="q7" value="C" onclick="grd(this)"> reflected the school’s lack of concern.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>D</b> <input type="radio" name="q7" value="D" onclick="grd(this)"> reflected a lack of knowledge and resources.</p>

<h2 style="padding-left: 30px;">What steps should schools take to reduce bullying?</h2>
<p>The most important step is for the school authorities to produce a <b>9 </b><input type="text" required="" id="q9" onkeyup="gtb(this)"> which&nbsp;makes the school's attitude towards bullying quite clear.</p>
<p>It should include detailed&nbsp;<b>10 </b><input type="text" required="" id="q10" onkeyup="gtb(this)"> as to how the school and its staff will react if bullying occurs.</p>
<p>In addition, action can be taken through the <b>11 </b><input type="text" required="" id="q11" onkeyup="gtb(this)"></p>
<p>This is particularly useful in the early part of the process, as a way of raising awareness and encouraging discussion.</p>
<p>On its own, however, it is insufficient to bring about a permanent solution.</p>
<p>Effective work can also be done with individual pupils and small groups.</p>
<p>For example, potential <b>12 </b><input type="text" required="" id="q12" onkeyup="gtb(this)"> of bullying can be trained to be more self-confident.</p>
<p>Or again,in dealing with group bullying, a 'no blame' approach, which avoids confronting the offender too directly, is often effective.</p>
<p>Playground supervision will be more effective if members of staff are trained to recognise the difference between bullying and mere <b>13 </b><input type="text" required="" id="q13" onkeyup="gtb(this)"></p>
