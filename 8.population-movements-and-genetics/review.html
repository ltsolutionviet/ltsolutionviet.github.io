            <p><strong>A</strong></p>
<p>Study of the origins and distribution of human populations used to be based on&nbsp;archaeological and fossil evidence. <span class="explainq1 explain">A&nbsp;number of techniques developed since&nbsp;the 1950s, however, have placed the&nbsp;study of these subjects on a sounder and&nbsp;more objective footing</span>. The best&nbsp;information on early population&nbsp;movements is now being obtained from&nbsp;the 'archaeology of the living body', the&nbsp;clues to be found in genetic material.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong></p>
<p><span class="explainq2 explain">Recent work on the problem of when people first entered the Americas</span> is an&nbsp;example of the value of these new&nbsp;techniques. North-east Asia and Siberia&nbsp;have long been accepted as the&nbsp;launching ground for the first human&nbsp;colonisers of the New World’. But was&nbsp;there one major wave of migration across&nbsp;the Bering Strait into the Americas, or&nbsp;several? And when did this event, or&nbsp;events, take place? In recent years, new&nbsp;clues have come from research into&nbsp;genetics, including the distribution of&nbsp;genetic markers in modern Native&nbsp;Americans<sup>1 2</sup>.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong></p>
<p>An important project, led by the&nbsp;biological anthropologist Robert Williams, focused on the variants (called Gm&nbsp;allotypes) of one particular protein -<span class="explainq3 explain">immunoglobin G - found in the fluid&nbsp;portion of human blood</span>. All proteins&nbsp;'drift', or produce variants, over the&nbsp;generations, and members of an&nbsp;interbreeding human population will&nbsp;share a set of such variants. Thus, by&nbsp;comparing the Gm allotypes of two&nbsp;different populations (e.g. two Indian tribes), one can establish their genetic&nbsp;'distance', <span class="explainq3 explain">which itself can be calibrated&nbsp;to give an indication of the length of time&nbsp;since these populations last interbred</span>.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong></p>
<p><span class="explainq4 explain">Williams and his colleagues sampled the blood of over 5,000 American Indians</span> in&nbsp;western North America during a twenty-year period. They found that their Gm&nbsp;allotypes could be divided into two&nbsp;groups, one of which also corresponded&nbsp;to the genetic typing of Central and South&nbsp;American Indians. <span class="explainq9 explain">Other tests showed&nbsp;that the Inuit (or Eskimo) and Aleut<sup>3&nbsp;</sup>formed a third group</span>. <span class="explainq4 explain">From this evidence&nbsp;it was deduced that there had been three&nbsp;major waves of migration</span> across the&nbsp;Bering Strait. <span class="explainq7 explain">The first, Paleo-lndian, wave&nbsp;more than 15,000 years ago was&nbsp;ancestral to all Central and South&nbsp;American Indians</span>. <span class="explainq10 explain">The second wave,&nbsp;about 14,000-12,000 years ago,&nbsp;brought Na-Dene hunters, ancestors of&nbsp;the Navajo and Apache</span> (<span class="explainq8 explain">who only&nbsp;migrated south from Canada about 600&nbsp;or 700 years ago</span>). The third wave,&nbsp;perhaps 10,000 or 9,000 years ago, saw&nbsp;the migration from North-east Asia of&nbsp;groups ancestral to the modern Eskimo&nbsp;and Aleut.</p>
<p><strong>E</strong></p>
<p>How far does other research support these conclusions? <span class="explainq5 explain">Geneticist Douglas&nbsp;Wallace has studied mitochondrial DNA</span><sup>4&nbsp;</sup>in blood samples from three widely&nbsp;separated Native American groups: Pima-Papago Indians in Arizona, Maya Indians&nbsp;on the Yucatán peninsula, Mexico, and&nbsp;Ticuna Indians in the Upper Amazon region of Brazil. <span class="explainq5 explain">As would have been&nbsp;predicted by Robert Williams's work</span>, all&nbsp;three groups appear to be descended&nbsp;from the same ancestral (Paleo-lndian)&nbsp;population.</p>
<p><strong>F</strong></p>
<p><span class="explainq6 explain">There are two other kinds of research that have thrown some light on the origins of&nbsp;the Native American population; they&nbsp;involve the study of teeth and of&nbsp;languages</span>. The biological anthropologist&nbsp;Christy Turner is an expert in the analysis&nbsp;of changing physical characteristics in&nbsp;human teeth. He argues that tooth&nbsp;crowns and roots<sup>5</sup> have a high genetic&nbsp;component, minimally affected by&nbsp;environmental and other factors. <span class="explainq13 explain">Studies&nbsp;carried out by Turner of many thousands&nbsp;of New and Old World specimens, both&nbsp;ancient and modern, suggest that the&nbsp;majority of prehistoric Americans are&nbsp;linked to Northern Asian populations</span> by&nbsp;crown and root traits such as incisor<sup>6&nbsp;</sup>shoveling (a scooping out on one or both&nbsp;surfaces of the tooth), single-rooted&nbsp;upper first premolars<sup>6</sup> and triple-rooted&nbsp;lower first molars<sup>6</sup>.</p>
<p>According to Turner, this ties in with the idea of a single Paleo-lndian migration&nbsp;out of North Asia, which he sets at before&nbsp;14,000 years ago by calibrating rates of&nbsp;dental micro-evolution. Tooth analyses&nbsp;also suggest that there were two later&nbsp;migrations of Na-Denes and Eskimo-Aleut.</p>
<p><strong>G</strong></p>
<p>The linguist Joseph Greenberg has, since the 1950s, argued that all Native&nbsp;American languages belong to a single&nbsp;'Amerind' family, except for Na-Dene and&nbsp;Eskimo-Aleut - a view that gives credence&nbsp;to the idea of three main migrations.&nbsp;Greenberg is in a minority among fellow&nbsp;linguists, most of whom favour the notion&nbsp;of a great many waves of migration to&nbsp;account for the more than 1,000&nbsp;languages spoken at one time by&nbsp;American Indians. But there is no doubt&nbsp;that the new genetic and dental evidence&nbsp;provides strong backing for Greenberg's&nbsp;view. Dates given for the migrations&nbsp;should nevertheless be treated with&nbsp;caution, except where supported by hard&nbsp;archaeological evidence.</p>
