            <p><strong>A</strong> Learning Theory is rooted in the work of Ivan Pavlov, the famous scien­tist who discovered and documented the principles governing<span class="explainq2 explain"> how animals (humans included) learn</span> in the 1900s. Two basic kinds of learning or condi­tioning occur, one of which is famously known as the classical conditioning. Classical conditioning happens when an animal learns to associate a neutral stimulus (signal) with a stimulus that has intrinsic meaning based on how closely in time the two stimuli are presented. The classic example of classical conditioning is a dog's ability to associate the sound of a bell (something that originally has no meaning to the dog) with the presentation of food (something that has a lot of meaning to the dog) a few moments later. Dogs are able to learn the association between bell and food, and will salivate im­mediately after hearing the bell once this connection has been made. Years of learning research have led to the creation of a highly precise learning theory that can be used to understand and predict how and under what cir­cumstances most any animal will learn, including human beings, and eventu­ally help people figure out how to change their behaviours.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> Role models are a popular notion for guiding child development, but in re­cent years very interesting research has been done on learning by examples in other animals. If the subject of animal learning is taught very much in terms of classical or operant conditioning, it places too much emphasis on how we allow animals to learn and not enough on how they are equipped to learn. To teach a course of mine, I have been dipping profitably into a very interesting and accessible compilation of papers on <span class="explainq9 explain explainq10">social</span> learning in mammals, including chimps and human children, edited by Heyes and Galef (1996).</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> The research reported in one paper started with <span class="explainq5 explain">a school field trip to Israel to a pine forest</span> where many pine cones were discovered, stripped to the central core. So the investigation started<span class="explainq5 explain"> with no weighty theoretical intent</span>, but was directed at finding out what was eating the nutritious pine seeds and how they managed to get them out of the cones. <span class="explainq3 explain">The culprit proved to be the versatile and athletic black rat</span>,(Rattus rattus), and the technique was to bite each cone scale off at its base,<span class="explainq6 explain"> in sequence from base to top</span> following the spiral growth pattern of the cone.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> <span class="explainq8 explain">Urban black rats were found to lack the skill and were unable to learn it even if housed with experienced cone strippers.</span> However, infants of urban mothers cross-fostered by stripper mothers acquired the skill, whereas in­fants of stripper mothers fostered by an urban mother could not. Clearly the skill had to be learned from the mother. Further elegant experiments showed that naive adults could develop the skill if they were provided with cones from which the first complete spiral of scales had been removed; <span class="explainq1 explain">rather like</span> <span class="explainq7 explain">our new photocopier which you can work out how to use once someone has shown you how to switch it on</span>. In the case of rats, the young­sters take cones away from the mother when she is still feeding on them, allowing them to acquire the complete stripping skill.</p>
<p><strong>E</strong> A good example of adaptive bearing we might conclude, but<span class="explainq4 explain"> let’s see the economies</span>. This was determined by measuring oxygen uptake of a rat strip­ping a cone in a metabolic chamber to calculate energetic cost and compar­ing it with the benefit of the pine seeds measured by calorimeter. The cost proved to be <span class="explainq9 explain">less</span> than 10% of the energetic value of the cone. An acceptable profit margin.</p>
<p><strong>F</strong> A paper in 1996, Animal Behaviour by Bednekoff and Baida, provides a differ­ent view of the adaptiveness of social learning. It concerns the seed caching behaviour of Clark's <span class="explainq13 explain">Nutcracker</span> (Nucifraga columbiana) and the Mexican Jay (Aphelocoma ultramarina). The former is a specialist, caching 30,000 or so seeds in scattered locations that it will recover over the months of winter; the Mexican Jay will also cache food but is much less dependent upon this than the Nutcracker. The two species also differ in their social structure: the Nutcracker being rather solitary while the Jay forages in social groups.</p>
<p><strong>G</strong> The experiment is to discover not just whether a bird can remember where it hid a seed but also if it can remember where it saw another bird hide a seed. The design is slightly comical with a cacher bird wandering about a room with lots of holes in the floor hiding food in some of the holes, while <span class="explainq10 explain explainq11">watched</span> by an <span class="explainq12 explain">observer</span> bird perched in a cage. Two days later, cachers and observers are tested for their discovery rate against an estimated random performance. In the role of cacher, not only the Nutcracker but also the less specialised Jay performed above chance; more surprisingly, however, jay obser­vers were as successful as jay cachers whereas nutcracker observers did no better than chance. It seems that, whereas the Nutcracker is highly adapted at remembering where it hid its own seeds, the social living Mexican Jay is more adept at remembering, and so exploiting, the caches of others.</p>
