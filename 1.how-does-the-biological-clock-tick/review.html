			<h2>HOW DOES THE BIOLOGICAL CLOCK TICK?</h2>

		<p><strong>A -&nbsp;Limitations of life span</strong></p>
		<p>Our life span is restricted. Everyone accepts this as ‘biologically’ obvious. ‘Nothing lives for ever!’ However, in this statement we think of artificially&nbsp;produced, technical objects, products which are subjected to natural wear and&nbsp;tear during use. This leads to the result that at some time or other the object&nbsp;stops working and is unusable (‘death’ in the biological sense). <span class="explainq37 explain">But are the&nbsp;wear and tear and loss of function of technical objects and the death of living&nbsp;organisms really similar or comparable?</span></p>
		<p><strong>B -&nbsp;Fundamental differences in ageing of objects&nbsp;and organisms</strong></p>
		<p>Our ‘dead’ products are ‘static’, closed systems. It is always the basic material which constitutes the object and which, in the natural course of things, is worn&nbsp;down and becomes ‘older’. Ageing in this case must occur according to the laws&nbsp;of <span class="explainq33 explain">physical chemistry</span> and of <span class="explainq34 explain">thermodynamics</span>. <span class="explainq27 explain">Although the same law holds&nbsp;for a living organism, the result of this law is not inexorable in the same way</span>. <span class="explainq38 explain">At least as long as a biological system has the ability to renew itself it could actually become older without ageing; an organism is an open, dynamic system&nbsp;through which new material continuously flows</span>. Destruction of old material&nbsp;and formation of new material are thus in permanent dynamic equilibrium.&nbsp;The material of which the organism is formed changes continuously. Thus our bodies continuously exchange old substance for new, just like a spring&nbsp;which more or less maintains its form and movement, but in which the water&nbsp;molecules are always different.</p>
		<p><strong>C -&nbsp;Why dying is beneficial</strong></p>
		<p>Thus ageing and death should not be seen as inevitable, particularly as the organism possesses many mechanisms for repair. It is not, in principle,&nbsp;necessary for a biological system to age and die. Nevertheless, a restricted life&nbsp;span, ageing, and then death are basic characteristics of life. The reason for&nbsp;this is easy to recognise: in nature, the existent organisms either <span class="explainq35 explain">adapt</span> or are&nbsp;regularly replaced by new types. Because of changes in the genetic material&nbsp;(mutations) these have new characteristics and in the course of their individual&nbsp;lives they are tested for optimal or better <span class="explainq35 explain">adaptation</span> to the environmental&nbsp;conditions. <span class="explainq28 explain"><span class="explainq36 explain">Immortality</span> would disturb this system - it needs room for new and&nbsp;better life. This is the basic problem of evolution.</span></p>
		<p><strong>D -&nbsp;A stable life span despite improvements</strong></p>
		<p>Every organism has a life span which is highly characteristic. There are striking differences in life span between different species, but within one species the&nbsp;parameter is relatively constant. For example, the average duration of human&nbsp;life has hardly changed in thousands of years. <span class="explainq29 explain">Although more and more people&nbsp;attain an advanced age as a result of developments in medical care and better&nbsp;nutrition, the characteristic upper limit for most remains 80 years.</span> A further&nbsp;argument against the simple wear and tear theory is the observation that the&nbsp;time within which organisms age lies between a few days (even a few hours for&nbsp;unicellular organisms) and several thousand years, as with mammoth trees.</p>
		<p><strong>E -&nbsp;The biological clock</strong></p>
		<p><span class="explainq30 explain">If a life span is a genetically determined biological characteristic, it is logically necessary to propose the existence of an internal clock</span>, which in some way&nbsp;measures and controls the ageing process and which finally determines death&nbsp;as the last step in a fixed programme. Like the life span, the metabolic rate has&nbsp;for different organisms a fixed mathematical relationship to the body mass. In&nbsp;comparison to the life span this relationship is ‘inverted’: the larger the organism&nbsp;the lower its metabolic rate. Again this relationship is valid not only for birds,&nbsp;but also, similarly on average within the systematic unit, for all other organisms&nbsp;(plants, animals, unicellular organisms).</p>
		<p><strong>F -&nbsp;Energy consumption</strong></p>
		<p><span class="explainq31 explain">Animals which behave ‘frugally’ with energy become particularly old, for example, crocodiles and tortoises</span>. Parrots and birds of prey are often held&nbsp;chained up. Thus they are not able to ‘experience life’ and so they attain a high&nbsp;life span in captivity. Animals which save energy by hibernation or lethargy&nbsp;(e.g. bats or hedgehogs) live much longer than those which are always active.&nbsp;The metabolic rate of mice can be reduced by a very low consumption of food&nbsp;(hunger diet). They then may live twice as long as their well fed comrades.&nbsp;Women become distinctly (about 10 per cent) older than men. If you examine&nbsp;the metabolic rates of the two sexes you establish that the higher male&nbsp;metabolic rate roughly accounts for the lower male life span. That means that&nbsp;they live life ‘energetically’ - more intensively, but not for as long.</p>
		<p><strong>G -&nbsp;Prolonging your life</strong></p>
		<p><span class="explainq32 explain">It follows from the above that <span class="explainq40 explain">sparing use of energy reserves</span> should tend to extend life</span>. Extreme high performance sports may lead to optimal&nbsp;cardiovascular performance, but they quite certainly do not prolong life.&nbsp;Relaxation lowers metabolic rate, as does adequate sleep and in general an&nbsp;equable and balanced personality. Each of us can develop his or her own&nbsp;‘energy saving programme’ with a little self-observation, critical self-control and,&nbsp;above all, logical consistency. Experience will show that to live in this way not&nbsp;only increases the life span but is also very healthy. This final aspect should not&nbsp;be forgotten.</p>
