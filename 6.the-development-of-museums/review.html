                <h2>The Development of Museums</h2>

            <p><strong>A -&nbsp;Collections of factual evidence</strong></p>
<p>The conviction that historical relics provide infallible testimony about the past is rooted in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when science was regarded&nbsp;as objective and value free. As one writer observes: 'Although it is now evident that&nbsp;artefacts are as easily altered as chronicles, public faith in their veracity endures: a&nbsp;tangible relic seems ipso facto real.' Such conviction was, until recently, reflected in&nbsp;museum displays. <span class="explainq5 explain">Museums used to look - and some still do - much like storage&nbsp;rooms of objects packed together in showcases: good for scholars who wanted to&nbsp;study the subtle differences in design, but not for the ordinary visitor, to whom it all&nbsp;looked alike</span>. Similarly, the information accompanying the objects often made little&nbsp;sense to the lay visitor. The content and format of explanations dated back to a time&nbsp;when the museum was the exclusive domain of the scientific researcher.</p>
<p><strong>B -&nbsp;Mixed views on current changes to museums</strong></p>
<p>Recently, however, attitudes towards history and the way it should be presented have altered. <span class="explainq6 explain">The key word in heritage display is now 'experience', the more exciting&nbsp;the better and, if possible, involving all the senses</span>. Good examples of this approach&nbsp;in the UK are the Jorvik Centre in York; the National Museum of Photography, Film&nbsp;and Television in Bradford; and the Imperial War Museum in London. In the US&nbsp;the trend emerged much earlier: Williamsburg has been a prototype for many&nbsp;heritage developments in other parts of the world. No one can predict where the&nbsp;process will end. On so-called heritage sites the re-enactment of historical events&nbsp;is increasingly popular, and computers will soon provide virtual reality experiences,&nbsp;which will present visitors with a vivid image of the period of their choice, in which&nbsp;they themselves can act as if part of the historical environment. <span class="explainq1 explain">Such developments&nbsp;have been criticised as an intolerable vulgarisation, but the success of many historical&nbsp;theme parks and similar locations suggests that the majority of the public does not&nbsp;share this opinion</span>.</p>
<p><strong>C -&nbsp;Fewer differences between public attractions</strong></p>
<p><span class="explainq2 explain">In a related development, the sharp distinction between museum and heritage sites on the one hand, and theme parks on the other, is <span class="explainq6 explain explainq7">gradually evaporating</span>.</span> They already&nbsp;borrow ideas and concepts from one another. For example, museums have adopted&nbsp;story lines for exhibitions, sites have accepted 'theming'as a relevant tool, and theme&nbsp;parks are moving towards more authenticity and research-based presentations. In&nbsp;zoos, animals are no longer kept in cages, but in great spaces, either in the open air or&nbsp;in enormous greenhouses, such as the jungle and desert environments in Burgers'Zoo&nbsp;in Holland. This particular trend is regarded as one of the major developments in the&nbsp;presentation of natural history in the twentieth century.</p>
<p><strong>D -&nbsp;Commercial pressures on people in charge</strong></p>
<p><span class="explainq11 explain">Theme parks are undergoing other changes, too, as they try to present more serious social and cultural issues, and move away from fantasy. This development is a&nbsp;response to market</span> forces and, although museums and heritage sites have a special,&nbsp;rather distinct, role to fulfil,<span class="explainq3 explain"> they are also operating in a very competitive environment,&nbsp;where visitors make choices on how and where to spend their free time</span>. Heritage and&nbsp;museum experts do not have to invent stories and recreate historical environments&nbsp;to attract their visitors: their assets are already in place. However, exhibits must be&nbsp;both based on artefacts and facts as we know them, and attractively presented. Those&nbsp;who are professionally engaged in the art of interpreting history are thus in a difficult&nbsp;position, as they must <span class="explainq8 explain">steer a narrow course between the demands of 'evidence'&nbsp;and 'attractiveness'</span>, especially given the increasing need in the heritage industry for&nbsp;income-generating activities.</p>
<p><strong>E -&nbsp;Interpreting the facts to meet visitor expectations</strong></p>
<p><span class="explainq4 explain">It could be claimed that in order to make everything in heritage <span class="explainq14 explain">more 'real', historical accuracy must be increasingly altered</span></span>. For example, Pithecanthropus erectus&nbsp;is depicted in an Indonesian museum with Malay facial features, because this&nbsp;corresponds to public perceptions. Similarly, in the Museum of Natural History in&nbsp;Washington, Neanderthal man is shown making a dominant gesture to his wife. <span class="explainq9 explain">Such&nbsp;presentations tell us more about contemporary perceptions of the world than about&nbsp;our ancestors</span>. There is one compensation, however, for the professionals who make&nbsp;these interpretations: if they did not provide the interpretation, visitors would do it&nbsp;for themselves, based on their own ideas, misconceptions and prejudices. And no&nbsp;matter how exciting the result, it would contain a lot more bias than the presentations&nbsp;provided by experts.</p>
<p><strong>F</strong></p>
<p><span class="explainq10 explain">Human bias is inevitable, but another source of bias in the representation of history has to do with the transitory nature of the materials themselves. The simple fact is&nbsp;that not everything from history survives the historical process.</span> Castles, palaces and&nbsp;cathedrals have a longer lifespan than the dwellings of ordinary people. The same&nbsp;applies to the furnishings and other contents of the premises.<span class="explainq13 explain"> In a town like Leyden in&nbsp;Holland, which in the seventeenth century was occupied by approximately the same&nbsp;number of inhabitants as today, people lived within the walled town, an area more&nbsp;than five times smaller than modern Leyden</span>. In most of the houses several families&nbsp;lived together in circumstances beyond our imagination. Yet in museums, fine period&nbsp;rooms give only an image of the lifestyle of the upper class of that era. No wonder&nbsp;that people who stroll around exhibitions are filled with nostalgia; the evidence in&nbsp;museums indicates that life was so much better in the past. This notion is induced by&nbsp;the bias in its representation in museums and heritage centres.</p>
