<p>Most of the courses at Canterbury College only take up four days of the week, leaving one day free for independent study.<br>The atmosphere at the College is that of an adult environment where a relationship of mutual respect is encouraged between students and tutors.</p>
<p>Canterbury is a student city with several institutes of Further and Higher Education. The city centre is just a five-minute walk from the College, easily accessible in lunch or study breaks.<br>Canterbury College has developed strong international links over the years and, as a result, <span class="explainq1 explain">many students have the opportunity of visiting and working in a European country in the course of their studies.</span></p>
<p><strong>Students' Union and SRC</strong><br>All students are automatically members of the Canterbury College Students' Union (CCSU) and can attend meetings. <span class="explainq2 explain">The Union is very active and is run by an Executive Committee elected by students in the Autumn Term</span>. The President is elected every Summer Term to provide continuity for the next academic year. Representatives from each area of study form the Student Representative Council (SRC) which allows every student a say in Union affairs. In addition to representing students internally in the College on the Academic Board and with a subcommittee of the College Corporation, the CCSU also belongs to the National Union of Students which represents the interests of students nationally. The Union also arranges and supports entertainments, sporting activities and trips.</p>
<p><strong>STUDENT FACILIITES</strong><br><strong>Learning Resources Centre (LRC)</strong><br>The Corey Learning Resources Centre provides easy access to a wide range of printed and audiovisual learning materials which can help students with coursework. There is ample space for quiet independent study and there are also areas for group work. Resources provided include books, journals, audio and video cassettes and CD-ROMs. Inter-library loans are available<br>locally and nationally via the British Library. All students are encouraged to use the Open Access Information Technology Centre situated on the first floor. This has a variety of computing, word processing and desktop publishing software.</p>
<p><strong>Bookshop</strong><br>A branch of Waterstone's bookshops is located on campus, where you can buy a range of stationery, drawing equipment, artists' materials and books, as well as many other useful items you may need.</p>
<p><strong>Children's Centre</strong><br>The College Children's Centre has places for under 5s with some subsidised places being available to students. <span class="explainq4 explain">Places are limited, so, if you are interested, apply early to reserve a place by contacting Linda Baker on the College telephone number.</span></p>
<p><strong>Refectory</strong><br>This provides refreshments between 08.30 and 19.00 with hot meals served three times a day. Healthy eating options are available.</p>
<p><strong>Coffee Shop</strong><br>This is open during normal College hours and serves light snacks and drinks. Proceeds from the Coffee Shop go to the Students' Union.</p>
