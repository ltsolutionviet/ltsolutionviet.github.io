                <h2>Language Strategy in Multinational Company</h2>

            <p><strong><span class="font17">A</span></strong><span class="font17">. The importance of language management in multinational companies has never been greater than today. Multinationals are becoming ever more conscious of the importance of global coordination as a&nbsp;source of competitive advantage and language remains the ultimate barrier to aspirations of international&nbsp;harmonization. Before attempting to consider language management strategies, companies will have to&nbsp;evaluate the magnitude of the language barrier confronting them and in doing so they will need to&nbsp;examine it in three dimensions: the Language Diversity, the Language Penetration and the Language&nbsp;Sophistication. Companies next need to turn their attention to how they should best manage language.&nbsp;There is a range of options from which MNCs can formulate their language strategy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17"><strong>B</strong>.&nbsp;</span><span class="font17">Lingua Franca: The simplest answer, though realistic only for English speaking companies, is to rely&nbsp;on ones native tongue. As recently as 1991 a survey of British exporting companies found that over a&nbsp;third used English exclusively in dealings with foreign customers. This attitude that —one language fits&nbsp;alll has also been carried through into the Internet age. A survey of the web sites of top American&nbsp;companies confirmed that over half made no provision for foreign language access, and another found&nbsp;that less than 10% of leading companies were able to respond adequately to emails other than in the&nbsp;company‘s language. Widespread though it is however, reliance on a single language is a strategy that&nbsp;is fatally flawed. It makes no allowance for the growing trend in Linguistic Nationalism whereby buyers&nbsp;in Asia, South America and the Middle East in particular are asserting their right to —work in the&nbsp;language of the customer!. It also fails to recognize the increasing vitality of languages such as Spanish,&nbsp;Arabic and Chinese that overtime are likely to challenge the dominance of English as a lingua franca. In&nbsp;the IT arena it ignores the rapid globalization of the Internet where the number of English-language&nbsp;ecommerce transactions, emails and web sites, is rapidly diminishing as a percentage of the total. Finally,&nbsp;the total reliance on a single language puts the English speaker at risk in negotiations. Contracts, rules&nbsp;and legislation are invariably written in the local language, and a company unable to operate in that&nbsp;language is vulnerable.</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="font17">C</span></strong><span class="font17">. Functional Multilingualism: Another improvised approach to Language is to rely on what has been&nbsp;termed —Functional Multilingualism!. Essentially what this means is to muddle through, relying on a&nbsp;mix of languages, pidgins and gestures to communicate by whatever means the parties have at their&nbsp;disposal. In a social context such a shared effort to make one another understand might be considered an&nbsp;aid to the bonding process with the frustration of communication being regularly punctuated by moments&nbsp;of absurdity and humor. However, as the basis for business negotiations it appears very hit-and-nuts.&nbsp;And yet Hagen‘s recent study suggests that 16% of international business transaction; are conducted in&nbsp;a —cocktail of languages.! Functional Multilingualism shares the same defects as reliance on a lingua&nbsp;franca and increases the probability of cognitive divergence between the parties engaged in the&nbsp;communication.</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="font17">D</span></strong><span class="font17">. External Language Resources: A more rational and obvious response to the language barrier is to&nbsp;employ external resources such as translators and interpreters, and certainly there are many excellent&nbsp;companies specialized in these fields. However, such a response is by no means an end to the language&nbsp;barrier. For a start these services can be very expensive with a top Simultaneous Interpreter, commanding&nbsp;daily rates as high as a partner in an international consulting company. Secondly, any good translator or&nbsp;interpreter will insist that to be fully effective they must understand the context of the subject matter.&nbsp;This is not always possible. In some cases it is prohibited by the complexity or specialization of the&nbsp;topic. Sometimes by lack of preparation time but most often the obstacle is the reluctance of the parties&nbsp;to explain the wider context to an&nbsp;<sub>=</sub>outsider</span><span class="font18">ll</span><span class="font17">. Another problem is that unless there has been considerable&nbsp;pre-explaining between the interpreter and his clients it is likely that there will be ambiguity and cultural&nbsp;overtones in the source messages the interpreter has to work with. They will of course endeavor to&nbsp;provide a hifidelity translation but in this circumstance the interpreter has to use initiative and guess&nbsp;work. This clearly injects a potential source of misunderstanding into the proceedings. Finally while a&nbsp;good interpreter will attempt to convey not only the meaning but also the spirit of any communication,&nbsp;there can be no doubt that there is a loss of rhetorical power when communications go through a third&nbsp;party. So in situations requiring negotiation, persuasion, humor etc. the use of an interpreter is a poor&nbsp;substitute for direct communication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17"><strong>E</strong>. Training: The immediate and understandable reaction to any skills shortage in a business is to consider&nbsp;personnel development and certainly the language training industry is well developed. Offering&nbsp;programs at almost every level and in numerous languages. However, without doubting the value of&nbsp;language training no company should be deluded into believing this to be assured of success. Training&nbsp;in most companies is geared to the economic cycle. When times are good, money is invested in training.&nbsp;When belts get tightened training is one of the first —luxuries! to be pared down. In a study conducted&nbsp;across four European countries, nearly twice as many companies said they needed language training in&nbsp;coming years as had conducted training in past years. This disparity between —good intentions! and&nbsp;—actual delivery!, underlines the problems of relying upon training for language skills. Unless the&nbsp;company is totally committed to sustaining the strategy even though bad times, it will fail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17"><strong>F</strong>. One notable and committed leader in the field of language training has been the Volkswagen Group.&nbsp;They have developed a language strategy over many years and in many respects can be regarded as a&nbsp;model of how to manage language professionally. However, the Volkswagen approach underlines that&nbsp;language training has to be considered a strategic rather than a tactical solution. In their system to&nbsp;progress from —basics! to —communications competence! in a language requires the completion of 6&nbsp;language stages each one demanding approximately 90 hours of refresher course, supported by many&nbsp;more hours of self-study, spread over a 6-9 month period. The completion of each stage is marked by a&nbsp;post-stage achievement test, which is a pre-requisite for continued training. So even this professionally&nbsp;managed program expects a minimum of three years of fairly intensive study to produce an accountant.&nbsp;Engineer, buyer or salesperson capable of working effectively in a foreign language. Clearly companies&nbsp;intending to pursue this route need to do so with realistic expectations and with the intention of sustaining&nbsp;the program over many years. Except in terms of —brush-up! courses for people who were previously&nbsp;fluent in a foreign language, training cannot be considered a quick fix and hence other methods will have&nbsp;to be considered.</span></p>
