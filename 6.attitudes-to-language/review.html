            <p>It is not easy to be systematic and objective about language study. Popular linguistic debate regularly deteriorates into invective and polemic. Language belongs to everyone, so most&nbsp;people feel they have a right to hold an opinion about it. And <span class="explainq1 explain">when opinions differ, emotions&nbsp;can run high</span>. <span class="explainq2 explain">Arguments can start as easily over minor points of usage as over major policies&nbsp;of linguistic education.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Language, moreover, is a very public behaviour, so it is easy for different usages to be noted and criticised. No part of society or social behaviour is exempt: <span class="explainq3 explain">linguistic factors influence&nbsp;how we judge personality, intelligence</span>, social status, educational standards, job aptitude,&nbsp;and many other areas of identity and social survival. As a result, it is easy to hurt, and to be&nbsp;hurt, when language use is unfeelingly attacked.</p>
<p><span class="explainq9 explain">In its most general sense, prescriptivism is the view that one variety of language has an inherently higher value than others, and that this ought to be imposed on the whole of&nbsp;the speech community</span>. The view is propounded especially in relation to grammar and&nbsp;vocabulary, and frequently with reference to pronunciation. The variety which is favoured,&nbsp;in this account, is usually a version of the 'standard' written language, especially as&nbsp;encountered in literature, or in the formal spoken language which most closely reflects this&nbsp;style. Adherents to this variety are said to speak or write 'correctly'; deviations from it are&nbsp;said to be 'incorrect!</p>
<p>All the main languages have been studied prescriptively, especially in the 18th century approach to the writing of grammars and dictionaries. The aims of these early grammarians&nbsp;were threefold: (a) they wanted to codify the principles of their languages, to show that&nbsp;there was a system beneath the apparent chaos of usage, (b) they wanted a means of&nbsp;settling disputes over usage, and (c) they wanted to point out what they felt to be common&nbsp;errors, in order to 'improve' the language. The authoritarian nature of the approach is best&nbsp;characterised by its reliance on â€˜<span class="explainq10 explain">rules</span>' of grammar. Some usages are 'prescribed,' to be&nbsp;learnt and followed accurately; others are 'proscribed,' to be avoided. In this early period,&nbsp;there were no half-measures: usage was either right or wrong, and it was the task of the&nbsp;grammarian not simply to record alternatives, but to pronounce judgement upon them.</p>
<p><span class="explainq5 explain">These attitudes are still with us</span>, and they motivate a widespread concern that linguistic standards should be maintained. Nevertheless, there is an alternative point of view that&nbsp;is concerned less with standards than with the facts of linguistic usage. This approach is&nbsp;summarised in the statement that it is the task of the grammarian to describe, not prescribe to record the facts of linguistic diversity, and not to attempt the impossible tasks of evaluating language variation or <span class="explainq6 explain">halting language change</span>. <span class="explainq7 explain">In the second half of the 18th&nbsp;century, we already find advocates of<span class="explainq11 explain"> this view</span></span>, such as Joseph Priestiey, whose Rudiments&nbsp;of English Grammar (1761) insists that '<span class="explainq12 explain">the custom of speaking</span> is the original and only&nbsp;just standard of any language! Linguistic issues, it is argued, cannot be solved by logic&nbsp;and legislation. And this view has become the tenet of the modern linguistic approach to&nbsp;grammatical analysis.</p>
<p><span class="explainq8 explain">In our own time, the opposition between 'descriptivists' and 'prescriptivists' has often become extreme, with both sides painting unreal pictures of the other</span>. Descriptive&nbsp;grammarians have been presented as people who do not care about standards, because&nbsp;of the way they see all forms of usage as equally valid. Prescriptive grammarians have&nbsp;been presented as blind adherents to a historical tradition. The opposition has even been&nbsp;presented in quasi-political terms - of radical liberalism vs elitist conservatism.</p>
