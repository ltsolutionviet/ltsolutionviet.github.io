            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A brilliant movement of colour as it catches its food in the air, the European bee-eater moves between three continents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">True to their name, bee-eaters eat bees (though their diet includes just about any flying insect). When the bird catches a bee, it returns to its tree to get rid of the bees <span class="explainq9 explain">poison</span>, which it does very efficiently. It hits the insect's head on one side of the branch, then rubs its body on the other. The rubbing makes its prey harmless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">European bee-eaters (Merops apiaster) form families that breed in the spring and summer across an area that extends from Spain to Kazakhstan. Farmland and <span class="explainq10 explain">river valleys</span> provide huge numbers of <span class="explainq8 explain">insects</span>. Flocks of bee-eaters follow tractors as they work fields. When the birds come upon a beehive, they eat well - a researcher once found a hundred bees in the stomach of a bee-eater near a hive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">European bees pass the winter by sleeping in their hives, which cuts off the bee-eater's main source of food. So, in late summer, bee-eaters begin a long, dangerous journey. Massive flocks from Spain, France and northern Italy cross the Sahara desert to their wintering grounds in West <span class="explainq11 explain">Africa</span>. Bee-eaters from Hungary&nbsp;and other parts of Central and Eastern Europe cross the Mediterranean Sea and Arabian Desert to winter in southern <span class="explainq11 explain">Africa</span>. 'It's an extremely risky stratagem, this migration,' says C. Hilary Fry, a British&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ornithologist who has studied European bee-eaters for more than 45 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">'At least 30 percent of the birds will be killed by <span class="explainq12 explain">predators</span> before they make it back to Europe the following spring.'</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April, they return to Europe. Birds build nests by digging <span class="explainq13 explain">tunnels</span> in riverbanks.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They work for up to 20 days.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the end of the job, they've moved 15 to 26 pounds of soil - more than 80 times their weight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nesting season is a time when families help each other, and sons or uncles help feed their father's or brother's <span class="explainq14 explain">chicks</span> as soon as they come out of their eggs. The helpers benefit, too: parents with helpers can provide more food for chicks to continue the family line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's a short, spectacular life. European bee-eaters live for five to six years. The difficulties of migration and avoiding predators along the way affect every bird. Bee-eaters today also find it harder to find food, as there are fewer insects around as a result of <span class="explainq15 explain">pesticides</span>. Breeding sites are also disappearing, as rivers are turned into concrete-walled canals.</span></p>
