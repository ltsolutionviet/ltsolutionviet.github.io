            <p><strong>A -&nbsp;People have always responded to climate change</strong></p>
<p>This book will provide a detailed examination of the Little Ice Age and other <span class="explain">climatic shifts</span>, but, before I embark on that, let me provide a historical context. We tend to&nbsp;think of climate - as opposed to weather - as something unchanging, yet humanity&nbsp;has been at the mercy of climate change for its entire existence, with at least eight&nbsp;glacial episodes in the past 730,000 years. Our ancestors adapted to the universal&nbsp;but irregular global warming since the end of the last great Ice Age, around 10,000&nbsp;years ago, with dazzling opportunism. They developed strategies for surviving&nbsp;harsh drought cycles, decades of heavy rainfall or unaccustomed cold; adopted&nbsp;agriculture and stock-raising, which revolutionised human life; and founded the&nbsp;world’s first pre-industrial civilisations in Egypt, Mesopotamia and the Americas.&nbsp;But the price of sudden climate change, in famine, disease and suffering, was often high.</p>
<p><strong>B -&nbsp;The relevance of the Little Ice Age today</strong></p>
<p>The Little Ice Age lasted from roughly 1300 until the middle of the nineteenth century. Only two centuries ago, Europe experienced a cycle of bitterly cold&nbsp;winters; mountain glaciers in the Swiss Alps were the lowest in recorded memory,&nbsp;and pack ice surrounded Iceland for much of the year. <span class=" explain">The climatic events of the&nbsp;Little Ice Age did more than help shape the modern world. They are the deeply&nbsp;important context for the current unprecedented global warming</span>. The Little Ice Age&nbsp;was far from a deep freeze, however; rather an irregular seesaw of rapid climatic&nbsp;shifts, few lasting more than a quarter-century, driven by complex and still little&nbsp;understood interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean. The seesaw&nbsp;brought cycles of intensely cold winters and easterly winds, then switched abruptly&nbsp;to.years of heavy spring and early summer rains, mild winters, and frequent Atlantic&nbsp;<span class=" explain">storms</span>, or to periods of droughts, light northeasterly winds, and summer <span class=" explain">heat&nbsp;waves</span>.</p>
<p><strong>C -&nbsp;How past climatic conditions can be determined</strong></p>
<p>Reconstructing the climate changes of the past is extremely difficult, because systematic weather observations began only a few centuries ago, in Europe and&nbsp;North America. Records from India and tropical Africa are even more recent.&nbsp;For the time before records began, we have only ‘proxy records’ reconstructed largely from <span class=" explain">tree rings</span> and <span class=" explain">ice cores</span>, supplemented by a few incomplete written&nbsp;accounts. We now have hundreds of tree-ring records from throughout the&nbsp;northern hemisphere, and many from south of the equator, too, amplified with a&nbsp;growing body of temperature data from ice cores drilled in Antarctica, Greenland,&nbsp;the Peruvian Andes, and other locations. We are close to a knowledge of annual&nbsp;summer and winter temperature variations over much of the northern hemisphere&nbsp;going back 600 years.</p>
<p><strong>D -&nbsp;A study covering a thousand years</strong></p>
<p><span class=" explain">This book is a narrative history of climatic shifts during the past ten centuries</span>, and some of the ways in which people in Europe adapted to them. <span class=" explain">Part One describes&nbsp;the Medieval Warm Period, roughly 900 to 1200. During these three centuries,&nbsp;Norse voyagers from Northern Europe explored northern seas, settled Greenland, and visited North America</span>. It was not a time of uniform warmth, for then, as always&nbsp;since the Great Ice Age, there were constant shifts in rainfall and temperature.&nbsp;Mean European temperatures were about the same as today, perhaps slightly cooler.</p>
<p><strong>E -&nbsp;Enough food at last</strong></p>
<p>It is known that the Little Ice Age cooling began in Greenland and the Arctic in about 1200. As the Arctic ice pack spread southward, Norse voyages to the west&nbsp;were rerouted into the open Atlantic, then ended altogether. Storminess increased&nbsp;in the North Atlantic and North Sea. Colder, much wetter weather descended on&nbsp;Europe between 1315 and 1319, when thousands perished in a continent-wide&nbsp;famine. By 1400, the weather had become decidedly more unpredictable and&nbsp;stormier, with sudden shifts and lower temperatures that culminated in the cold&nbsp;decades of the late sixteenth century. Fish were a vital commodity in growing&nbsp;towns and cities, where food supplies were a constant concern. <span class=" explain">Dried cod and&nbsp;herring were already the staples of the European fish trade, but changes in water&nbsp;temperatures forced fishing fleets to work further offshore</span>. The Basques, Dutch,&nbsp;and English developed the first offshore fishing boats adapted to a colder and&nbsp;stormier Atlantic. A gradual agricultural revolution in northern Europe stemmed&nbsp;from concerns over food supplies at a time of rising populations. The revolution&nbsp;involved intensive commercial farming and the growing of animal fodder on land&nbsp;not previously used for crops. <span class=" explain">The increased productivity from farmland made&nbsp;some countries self-sufficient in grain and livestock and offered effective protection&nbsp;against famine.</span></p>
<p><strong>F -&nbsp;Human impact on the climate</strong></p>
<p>Global temperatures began to rise slowly after 1850, <span class=" explain">with the beginning of the Modern Warm Period. There was a vast migration from Europe by land-hungry&nbsp;farmers and others,</span> to which the famine caused by the Irish potato blight&nbsp;contributed, to North America, Australia, New Zealand, and southern Africa.&nbsp;<span class=" explain">Millions of hectares of forest and woodland fell before the newcomers’ axes between 1850 and 1890</span>, as intensive European farming methods expanded&nbsp;across the world. <span class=" explain">The unprecedented land clearance released vast quantities of&nbsp;carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, triggering for the first time humanly caused&nbsp;global warming</span>. Temperatures climbed more rapidly in the twentieth century as&nbsp;the use of fossil fuels proliferated and greenhouse gas levels continued to soar.&nbsp;The rise has been even steeper since the early 1980s. The Little Ice Age has given&nbsp;way to a new climatic regime, marked by prolonged and steady warming. At the&nbsp;same time, extreme weather events like Category 5 hurricanes are becoming more&nbsp;frequent.</p>
