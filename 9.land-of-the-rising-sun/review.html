            <p><strong>A -&nbsp;Research findings concerning achievements in maths</strong></p>
<p>Japan has a significantly better record in terms of average mathematical attainment than England and Wales. Large sample international comparisons of pupils'&nbsp;attainments since the 1960s have established that not only did Japanese pupils&nbsp;at age 13 have better scores of average attainment, <span class="explainq6 explain">but there was also a larger&nbsp;proportion of 'low' attainers in England, where, incidentally, the variation in&nbsp;attainment scores was much greater.</span> <span class="explainq7 explain">The percentage of Gross National Product&nbsp;spent on education is reasonably similar in the two countries, so how is this higher&nbsp;and more consistent attainment in maths achieved?</span></p>
<p><strong>B -&nbsp;Background to middle-years education in Japan</strong></p>
<p><span class="explainq1 explain">Lower secondary schools in Japan cover three school years, from the seventh grade (age 13) to the ninth grade (age 15)</span>. Virtually all pupils at this stage attend&nbsp;state schools: only 3 per cent are in the private sector. Schools are usually modem&nbsp;in design, set well back from the road and spacious inside. Classrooms are large&nbsp;and pupils sit at single desks in rows. Lessons last for a standardised 50 minutes&nbsp;and are always followed by a 10-minute break, which gives the pupils a chance to&nbsp;let off steam. Teachers begin with a formal address and mutual bowing, and then&nbsp;concentrate on whole-class teaching.</p>
<p>Classes are large - usually about 40 - and are unstreamed. Pupils stay in the same class for all lessons throughout the school and develop considerable class&nbsp;identity and loyalty. Pupils attend the school in their own neighbourhood, which&nbsp;in theory removes ranking by school. In practice in Tokyo, because of the relative&nbsp;concentration of schools, there is some competition to get into the 'better' school in&nbsp;a particular area.</p>
<p><strong>C -&nbsp;The influence of Monbusho</strong></p>
<p>Traditional ways of teaching form the basis of the lesson and the remarkably quiet classes take their own notes of the points made and the examples demonstrated.&nbsp;Everyone has their own copy of the textbook supplied by the central education&nbsp;authority, Monbusho, as part of the concept of free compulsory education up to&nbsp;the age of 15. <span class="explainq10 explain">These textbooks are, on the whole, small, presumably inexpensive to&nbsp;produce</span>, but well set out and logically developed. (One teacher was particularly&nbsp;keen to introduce colour and pictures into maths textbooks: <span class="explainq10 explain">he felt this would make&nbsp;them more accessible to pupils</span> brought up in a cartoon culture.) <span class="explainq2 explain">Besides approving&nbsp;textbooks, Monbusho also decides the highly centralised national curriculum and&nbsp;how it is to be delivered.</span></p>
<p><strong>D -&nbsp;The typical format of a maths lesson</strong></p>
<p><span class="explainq3 explain">Lessons all follow the same pattern. At the beginning, the pupils put solutions to the homework on the board, then the teachers comment, correct or elaborate&nbsp;as necessary.</span> <span class="explainq9 explain">Pupils mark their own homework</span>: this is an important principle in&nbsp;Japanese schooling as it enables pupils to see where and why they made a mistake,&nbsp;so that these can be avoided in future. No one minds mistakes or ignorance as long&nbsp;as you are prepared to learn from them.</p>
<p><span class="explainq11 explain">After the homework has been discussed, the teacher explains the topic of the lesson, slowly and with a lot of repetition and elaboration</span>. Examples are&nbsp;demonstrated on the board; questions from the textbook are worked through&nbsp;first with the class, and then the class is set questions from the textbook to&nbsp;do individually. Only rarely are supplementary worksheets distributed in a&nbsp;maths class. The impression is that the logical nature of the textbooks and their&nbsp;comprehensive coverage of different types of examples, combined with the relative&nbsp;homogeneity of the class, renders work sheets unnecessary. At this point, the&nbsp;teacher would circulate and make sure that all the pupils were coping well.</p>
<p><strong>E -&nbsp;Helping less successful students</strong></p>
<p>It is remarkable that large, mixed-ability classes could be kept together for maths throughout all their compulsory schooling from 6 to 15. Teachers say that they&nbsp;give individual help at the end of a lesson or after school, setting extra work if&nbsp;necessary. <span class="explainq4 explain">In observed lessons, any strugglers would be assisted by the teacher&nbsp;or quietly seek help from their neighbour</span>. Carefully fostered class identity makes&nbsp;pupils keen to help each other - anyway, it is in their interests since the class&nbsp;progresses together.</p>
<p>This scarcely seems adequate help to enable slow learners to keep up. However, the Japanese attitude towards education runs along the lines of 'if you work hard&nbsp;enough, you can do almost anything'. Parents are kept closely informed of their&nbsp;children's progress and will play a part in helping their children to keep up with&nbsp;class, <span class="explainq12 explain">sending them to 'Juku' (private evening tuition) if extra help is needed and&nbsp;encouraging them to work harder</span>. It seems to work, at least for 95 per cent of the&nbsp;school population.</p>
<p><strong>F -&nbsp;The key to Japanese successes in maths education</strong></p>
<p><span class="explainq5 explain">So what are the major contributing factors in the success of maths teaching?&nbsp;Clearly, attitudes are important. Education is valued greatly in Japanese culture; <span class="explainq13 explain">maths is recognised as an important compulsory subject throughout schooling</span>; and&nbsp;the emphasis is on hard work coupled with a focus on accuracy.</span></p>
<p>Other relevant points relate to the supportive attitude of a class towards slower pupils, the lack of competition within a class, and the positive emphasis on learning&nbsp;for oneself and improving one's own standard. And the view of repetitively boring&nbsp;lessons and learning the facts by heart, which is sometimes quoted in relation&nbsp;to Japanese classes, may be unfair and unjustified. No poor maths lessons were&nbsp;observed. They were mainly good and one or two were inspirational.</p>
