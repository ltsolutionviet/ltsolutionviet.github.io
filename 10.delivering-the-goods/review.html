            <p style="text-align: center;"><em>The vast expansion in international trade owes much to a revolution in the business of moving freight&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>A</strong></p>
<p>International trade is growing at a startling pace. <span class="explainq5 explain">While the global economy has been expanding at a bit over 3% a year, the volume of trade has been rising at a compound annual rate of about&nbsp;twice that</span>. Foreign products, from meat to machinery, play a more important role in almost every&nbsp;economy in the world, and foreign markets now tempt businesses that never much worried&nbsp;about sales beyond their nation's borders.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong></p>
<p>What lies behind this explosion in international commerce? The general worldwide decline in trade barriers, such as customs duties and import quotas, is surely one explanation. The&nbsp;economic opening of countries that have traditionally been minor players is another. But one&nbsp;force behind the import-export boom has passed all but unnoticed: the rapidly falling cost of&nbsp;getting goods to market. Theoretically, in the world of trade, shipping costs do not matter.&nbsp;Goods, once they have been made, are assumed to move instantly and at no cost from&nbsp;place to place. The real world, however, is full of frictions. <span class="explainq6 explain">Cheap labour may make Chinese&nbsp;clothing competitive in America, but if delays in shipment lie up working capital and cause&nbsp;winter coats to arrive in spring, trade may lose its advantages</span>.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong></p>
<p>At the turn of the 20th century, agriculture and manufacturing were the two most important sectors almost everywhere, accounting for about 70% of total output in Germany, Italy and&nbsp;France, and 40-50% in America, Britain and Japan. International commerce was therefore&nbsp;dominated by raw materials, such as wheat, wood and iron ore, or processed commodities,&nbsp;such as meat and steel. But these sorts of products are heavy and bulky and the cost of&nbsp;transporting them relatively high.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong></p>
<p><span class="explainq8 explain">Countries still trade disproportionately with their geographic neighbours</span>. Over time, however, world output has shitted into goods whose worth is unrelated to their size and weight. Today,&nbsp;it is finished manufactured products that dominate the flow of trade, and, thanks to&nbsp;technological advances such as lightweight components, manufactured goods themselves&nbsp;have tended to become lighter and less bulky. <span class="explainq4 explain">As a result, less transportation is required for&nbsp;every dollar's worth of imports or exports</span>.</p>
<p><strong>E</strong></p>
<p>To see how this influences trade, consider the business of making disk drives for computers. Most of the world's disk-drive manufacturing is concentrated in South-east Asia. This is&nbsp;possible only because disk drives, while valuable, are small and light and so cost little to&nbsp;ship. <span class="explainq3 explain">&nbsp;<span class="explainq11 explain">Computer manufacturers in Japan or Texas will not face hugely bigger freight bills if&nbsp;they import drives from Singapore rather than purchasing them on the domestic market</span></span>.&nbsp;Distance therefore poses no obstacle to the globalisation of the disk-drive industry.</p>
<p><strong>F</strong></p>
<p>This is even more true of the fast-growing information industries. Films and compact discs cost little to transport, even by aeroplane. <span class="explainq2 explain">Computer software can be 'exported' without ever&nbsp;loading it onto a ship, simply by transmitting it over telephone lines from one country to&nbsp;another</span>, so freight rates and cargo-handling schedules become insignificant factors in&nbsp;deciding where to make the product. Businesses can locate based on other considerations,&nbsp;such as the availability of labour, while worrying less about the cost of delivering their output.</p>
<p><strong>G</strong></p>
<p><span class="explainq10 explain">In many countries deregulation has helped to drive the process along. But, behind the scenes, a series of technological innovations known broadly as containerisation and intermodal transportation has led to swift productivity improvements in cargo-handling</span>. Forty&nbsp;years ago, the process of exporting or importing involved a great many stages of handling,&nbsp;which risked portions of the shipment being damaged or stolen along the way. The invention&nbsp;of the container crane made it possible to load and unload containers without capsizing the&nbsp;ship and the adoption of standard container sizes allowed almost any box to be transported&nbsp;on any ship. By 1967, dual-purpose ships, carrying loose cargo in the hold* and containers&nbsp;on the deck, were giving way to all-container vessels that moved thousands of boxes at a&nbsp;time.</p>
<p><strong>H</strong></p>
<p><span class="explainq12 explain">The shipping container transformed ocean shipping into a highly efficient, intensely competitive business</span>. But getting the cargo to and from the dock was a different story.&nbsp;National governments, by and large, kept a much firmer hand on truck and railroad tariffs&nbsp;than on charges for ocean freight. This started changing, however, in the mid-1970s, when&nbsp;America began to deregulate its transportation industry. First airlines, then road hauliers and&nbsp;railways, were freed from restrictions on what they could carry, where they could haul it and&nbsp;what price they could charge. Big productivity gains resulted. Between 1985 and 1996, for&nbsp;example, America's freight railways dramatically reduced their employment, trackage, and&nbsp;their fleets of locomotives - while increasing the amount of cargo they hauled. Europe's&nbsp;railways have also shown marked, albeit smaller, productivity improvements.</p>
<p><strong>I</strong></p>
<p>In America the period of huge productivity gains in transportation may be almost over, but in most countries the process still has far to go. State ownership of railways and airlines,&nbsp;regulation of freight rates and toleration of anti-competitive practices, such as&nbsp;cargo-handling monopolies, all <span class="explainq13 explain">keep the cost of shipping unnecessarily high</span> and deter&nbsp;international trade. <span class="explainq1 explain">Bringing these barriers down would help the worldâ€™s economies grow&nbsp;even closer</span>.</p>
