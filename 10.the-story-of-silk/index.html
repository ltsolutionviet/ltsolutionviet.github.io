            <p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>The history of the world’s most luxurious fabric, from ancient China&nbsp;</strong></em><em><strong>to the present day</strong></em></p>
<p>Silk is a fine, smooth material produced from the cocoons - soft protective shells&nbsp;- that are made by mulberry silkworms&nbsp;(insect larvae). Legend has it that it was&nbsp;Lei Tzu, wife of the Yellow Emperor,&nbsp;ruler of China in about 3000 BC, who&nbsp;discovered silkworms. One account of the&nbsp;story goes that as she was taking a walk&nbsp;in her husband’s gardens, she discovered&nbsp;that silkworms were responsible for the&nbsp;destruction of several mulberry trees. She&nbsp;collected a number of cocoons and sat&nbsp;down to have a rest. It just so happened&nbsp;that while she was sipping some tea, one&nbsp;of the cocoons that she had collected&nbsp;landed in the hot tea and started to&nbsp;unravel into a fine thread. Lei Tzu found&nbsp;that she could wind this thread around her&nbsp;fingers. Subsequently, she persuaded her&nbsp;husband to allow her to rear silkworms&nbsp;on a grove of mulberry trees. She also&nbsp;devised a special reel to draw the fibres&nbsp;from the cocoon into a single thread so&nbsp;that they would be strong enough to be&nbsp;woven into fabric. While it is unknown&nbsp;just how much of this is true, it is certainly&nbsp;known that silk cultivation has existed in&nbsp;China for several millennia.</p>
<p>Originally, silkworm farming was solely restricted to women, and it was they&nbsp;who were responsible for the growing,&nbsp;harvesting and weaving. Silk quickly grew&nbsp;into a symbol of status, and originally,&nbsp;only royalty were entitled to have clothes&nbsp;made of silk. The rules were gradually&nbsp;relaxed over the years until finally during&nbsp;the Qing Dynasty (1644—1911 AD), even&nbsp;peasants, the lowest caste, were also&nbsp;entitled to wear silk. Sometime during the&nbsp;Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 AD), silk was&nbsp;so prized that it was also used as a unit of&nbsp;currency. Government officials were paid&nbsp;their salary in silk, and farmers paid their&nbsp;taxes in grain and silk. Silk was also used&nbsp;as diplomatic gifts by the emperor. Fishing&nbsp;lines, bowstrings, musical instruments&nbsp;and paper were all made using silk. The&nbsp;earliest indication of silk paper being used&nbsp;was discovered in the tomb of a noble&nbsp;who is estimated to have died around&nbsp;168 AD.</p>
<p>Demand for this exotic fabric eventually created the lucrative trade route now&nbsp;known as the Silk Road, taking silk&nbsp;westward and bringing gold, silver and wool to the East. It was named the Silk&nbsp;Road after its most precious commodity, which was considered to be worth more&nbsp;than gold. The Silk Road stretched over&nbsp;6,000 kilometres from Eastern China to&nbsp;the Mediterranean Sea, following the Great Wall of China, climbing the Pamir&nbsp;mountain range, crossing modern-day&nbsp;Afghanistan and going on to the Middle&nbsp;East, with a major trading market in&nbsp;Damascus. From there, the merchandise&nbsp;was shipped across the Mediterranean&nbsp;Sea. Few merchants travelled the entire&nbsp;route; goods were handled mostly by a&nbsp;series of middlemen.</p>
<p>With the mulberry silkworm being native to China, the country was the world’s sole&nbsp;producer of silk for many hundreds of&nbsp;years. The secret of silk-making eventually&nbsp;reached the rest of the world via the Byzantine Empire, which ruled over the&nbsp;Mediterranean region of southern Europe,&nbsp;North Africa and the Middle East during&nbsp;the period 330—1453 AD. According to&nbsp;another legend, monks working for the&nbsp;Byzantine emperor Justinian smuggle silkworm eggs to Constantinople&nbsp;(Istanbul in modern-day Turkey) in 550&nbsp;AD, concealed inside hollow bamboo&nbsp;walking canes. The Byzantines were as&nbsp;secretive as the Chinese, however, and&nbsp;for many centuries the weaving and&nbsp;trading of silk fabric was a strict imperial&nbsp;monopoly. Then in the seventh century,&nbsp;the Arabs conquered Persia, capturing&nbsp;their magnificent silks in the process.</p>
<p>Silk production thus spread through Africa, Sicily and Spain as the Arabs swept, through these lands. Andalusia in southern Spain was Europe’s main silk-producing centre in the tenth century. By&nbsp;the thirteenth century, however, Italy had&nbsp;become Europe’s leader in silk production&nbsp;and export. Venetian merchants traded&nbsp;extensively in silk and encouraged silk&nbsp;growers to settle in Italy. Even now,&nbsp;silk processed in the province of Como&nbsp;in northern Italy enjoys an esteemed&nbsp;reputation.</p>
<p>The nineteenth century and industrialisation saw the downfall of the&nbsp;European silk industry. Cheaper Japanese&nbsp;silk, trade in which was greatly facilitated&nbsp;by the opening of the Suez Canal, was one&nbsp;of the many factors driving the trend. Then&nbsp;in the twentieth century, new manmade&nbsp;fibres, such as nylon, started to be used in&nbsp;what had traditionally been silk products,&nbsp;such as stockings and parachutes. The two&nbsp;world wars, which interrupted the supply&nbsp;of raw material from Japan, also stifled the&nbsp;European silk industry. After the Second&nbsp;World War, Japan’s silk production was&nbsp;restored, with improved production and&nbsp;quality of raw silk. Japan was to remain&nbsp;the world’s biggest producer of raw silk,&nbsp;and practically the only major exporter&nbsp;of raw silk, until the 1970s. However, in&nbsp;more recent decades, China has gradually&nbsp;recaptured its position as the world’s&nbsp;biggest producer and exporter of raw&nbsp;silk and silk yarn. Today, around 125,000&nbsp;metric tons of silk are produced in the&nbsp;world, and almost two thirds of that&nbsp;production takes place in China.</p>
