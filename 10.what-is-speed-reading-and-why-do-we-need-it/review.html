            <p><strong>A - The fastest reading speeds / A&nbsp;definition of speed reading</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span class="explainq5 explain">Speed reading is not just about reading fast. It is also about how much information you can remember when you have finished reading</span>. The World Championship Speed-Reading Competition says that its top competitors average between <span class="explainq2 explain">1,000 and 2,000 words a minute</span>. But they must remember at least 50 percent of this in order to qualify for the competition.</span></p>
<p><strong>B&nbsp;-&nbsp;The types of people who need to read more quickly</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowadays, speed reading has become an essential skill in any environment where people have to master a large volume of information. <span class="explainq1 explain">Professional workers</span> need reading skills to help them get through many documents every day, while <span class="explainq1 explain">students</span> under pressure to deal with assignments may feel they have to read more and read faster all the time.</span></p>
<p><strong>C - What you should consider before you start reading</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although there are various methods to increase reading speed,<span class="explainq6 explain"> the trick is deciding what information you want first</span>. For example, if you only want a rough outline of an issue, then you can skim the material quickly and extract the key facts. However, if you need to understand every detail in a document, then you must read it slowly enough to understand this.</span></p>
<p><strong>D</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even when you know how to ignore irrelevant detail, there are other improvements you can make to your reading style which will increase your speed. For example, most people can read much faster if they read silently. Reading each word aloud takes time for the information to make a complete circuit in your brain before being pronounced. Some researchers believe that as long as the first and last letters are in place, the brain can still understand the arrangement&nbsp;</span>of the other letters in the word because it logically puts each piece into place.</p>
<p><strong>E</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chunking is another important method. Most people learn to read either letter by letter or word by word.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you improve, this changes. You will probably find that you are fixing your eyes on a block of words, then moving your eyes to the next block of words, and so on. You are reading blocks of words at a time, not individual words one by one. You may also notice that you do not always go from one block to the next: sometimes you may move back to a previous block if you are unsure about something.</span></p>
<p><strong>F</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A <strong>skilled reader</strong> will read a lot of <span class="explainq7 explain">words</span> in each block.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He or she will only look at each block for an instant and will then move on. Only rarely will the reader’s eyes skip back to a previous block of words. This reduces the amount of work that the reader’s <span class="explainq8 explain">eyes</span> have to do.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also increases the volume of <span class="explainq9 explain">information</span> that can be taken in over a given period of time.</span></p>
<p><strong>G - How a reader can become confused</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, a <span class="explainq10 explain">slow reader</span> will spend a lot of time reading small blocks of words. <span class="explainq3 explain">He or she will skip back <span class="explainq11 explain">often</span>, losing the flow and structure of the text, and muddling their overall understanding of the subject</span>. This irregular eye movement quickly makes the reader <span class="explainq12 explain">tired</span>. Poor readers tend to dislike reading because they feel it is difficult to <span class="explainq13 explain">concentrate</span> and comprehend written information.</span></p>
<p><strong>H - Why reading material should be interesting</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best tip anyone can have to improve their reading speed is to practise. In order to do this effectively, <span class="explainq4 explain">a person must be engaged in the material and want to know more</span>. If you find yourself constantly having to re-read the same paragraph, you may want to switch to reading material that grabs your attention. If you enjoy what you are reading, you will make quicker progress.</span></p>
