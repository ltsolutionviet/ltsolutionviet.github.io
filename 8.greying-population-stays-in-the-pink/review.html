            <p>Elderly people are growing healthier, happier and more independent, say American scientists. The results of a 14-year study to be announced later this month reveal that the&nbsp;<span class="explainq1 explain">&nbsp;<span class="explainq3 explain">diseases associated with old age are afflicting fewer and fewer people and when they do&nbsp;strike, it is much later in life</span></span><span style="font-size: 11px;">.</span></p>
<p>In the last 14 years, the National Long-term Health Care Survey has gathered data on the health and lifestyles of more than 20,000 men and women over 65. Researchers, now&nbsp;analysing the results of data gathered in 1994, say arthritis, high blood pressure and&nbsp;circulation problems - the major medical complaints in this age group - are troubling a&nbsp;smaller proportion every year. <span class="explainq2 explain">And the data confirms that the rate at which these diseases&nbsp;are declining continues to accelerate</span>. Other diseases of old age - dementia, stroke,&nbsp;arteriosclerosis and emphysema - are also troubling fewer and fewer people.</p>
<p>'It really raises the question of what should be considered normal ageing,' says Kenneth Manton, a demographer from Duke University in North Carolina. He says the problems&nbsp;doctors accepted as normal in a 65-year-old in 1982 are often not appearing until people&nbsp;are 70 or 75.</p>
<p><span class="explainq5 explain">Clearly, certain diseases are beating a retreat in the face of medical advances. But there may be other contributing factors. Improvements in childhood nutrition in the first quarter of&nbsp;the twentieth century, for example, gave today's elderly people a better start in life than&nbsp;their predecessors</span>.</p>
<p>On the downside, the data also reveals failures in public health that have caused surges in some illnesses. <span class="explainq6 explain">An increase in some cancers and bronchitis may reflect changing smoking&nbsp;habits and poorer air quality, say the researchers. 'These may be subtle influences,' says&nbsp;Manton, 'but our subjects have been exposed to worse and worse pollution</span> for over 60&nbsp;years. It's not surprising we see some effect.'</p>
<p><span class="explainq7 explain">One interesting correlation Manton uncovered is that better-educated people are likely to live longer</span>. For example, 65-year-old women with fewer than eight years of schooling are&nbsp;expected, on average, to live to 82. Those who continued their education live an extra seven&nbsp;years. Although some of this can be attributed to a higher income, Manton believes it is&nbsp;mainly because educated people seek more medical attention.</p>
<p>The survey also assessed how independent people over 65 were, and again found a striking trend. Almost 80% of those in the 1994 survey could complete everyday activities ranging&nbsp;from eating and dressing unaided to complex tasks such as cooking and managing their&nbsp;finances. <span class="explainq8 explain">That represents a significant drop in the number of disabled old people in the&nbsp;population</span>. If the trends apparent in the United States 14 years ago had continued,</p>
<p>researchers calculate there would be an additional one million disabled elderly people in today's population. <span class="explainq9 explain">According to Manton, slowing the trend has saved the United States&nbsp;government's Medicare system more than $200 billion</span>, suggesting that the greying of&nbsp;America's population may prove less of a financial burden than expected.</p>
<p><span class="explainq10 explain">The increasing self-reliance of many elderly people is probably linked to a massive increase in the use of simple home medical aids</span>. For instance, the use of raised toilet seats has more&nbsp;than doubled since the start of the study, and the use of bath seats has grown by more than&nbsp;50%. These developments also bring some health benefits, according to a report from the&nbsp;MacArthur Foundation's research group on successful ageing. The group found that those&nbsp;elderly people who were able to retain a sense of independence were more likely to stay&nbsp;healthy in old age.</p>
<p><span class="explainq11 explain">Maintaining a level of daily physical activity may help mental functioning</span>, says Carl Cotman, a neuroscientist at the University of California at Irvine. He found that rats that exercise on a&nbsp;treadmill have raised levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor coursing through their&nbsp;brains. Cotman believes this hormone, which keeps neurons functioning, may prevent the&nbsp;brains of active humans from deteriorating.</p>
<p>As part of the same study, Teresa Seeman, a social epidemiologist at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, found a connection between self-esteem and stress in&nbsp;people over 70. <span class="explainq12 explain">In laboratory simulations of challenging activities such as driving, those who&nbsp;felt in control of their lives pumped out lower levels of stress hormones such as cortisol</span>.&nbsp;Chronically high levels of these hormones have been linked to heart disease.</p>
<p>But independence can have drawbacks. <span class="explainq13 explain">Seeman found that elderly people who felt emotionally isolated maintained higher levels of stress hormones even when asleep</span>. The&nbsp;research suggests that older people fare best when they feel independent but know they&nbsp;can get help when they need it.</p>
<p>'Like much research into ageing, these results support common sense,' says Seeman. They also show that we may be underestimating the impact of these simple factors. 'The sort of&nbsp;thing that your grandmother always told you turns out to be right on target,' she says.</p>
