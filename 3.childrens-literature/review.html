            <p><span class="font7"><strong>A</strong>&nbsp;I am sometimes asked why anyone who is not a teacher or a librarian or the parent of little kids&nbsp;should concern herself with children's books and&nbsp;folklore. I know <span class="explainq1 explain">the standard answers</span>: that many&nbsp;famous writers have written for children, and&nbsp;that the great children's books are also great&nbsp;literature; that these books and tales are an&nbsp;important source of archetype and symbol, and&nbsp;that they can help us to understand the structure&nbsp;and functions of the novel.</span></p>
<div style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid black; background-color: #dddddd;"><strong>Note Q1</strong>: The paragraph is mainly about '<strong>the standard answers</strong>' people give when asked why children's literature is important.</div>
<p><strong><span class="font5">B&nbsp;</span></strong><span class="font7">All this is true. But I think we should also take children's literature seriously because it is&nbsp;sometimes <span class="explainq2 explain">subversive</span>: because its values are not&nbsp;always those of the conventional adult world. Of&nbsp;course, in a sense much great literature is&nbsp;subversive, since its very existence implies that&nbsp;what matters is art, imagination and truth. In&nbsp;what we call the real world, what usually counts&nbsp;is money, power and public success.</span></p>
<div style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid black; background-color: #dddddd;"><strong>Note Q2</strong>: The paragraph is mainly about a further reason why children's literature is important, in addition to the reasons given in paragraph A - that it is '<strong>subversive</strong>' (opposed to the normal rules of society).</div>
<p><span class="font7"><strong>C</strong>&nbsp;The great subversive works of children's literature suggest that there are other views of&nbsp;human life besides those of the shopping mall&nbsp;and the corporation. They mock current&nbsp;assumptions and express the imaginative,&nbsp;unconventional,&nbsp;noncommercial&nbsp;view of the&nbsp;world in its simplest and purest form. They&nbsp;<span class="explainq3 explain">appeal to the imaginative</span>, questioning,&nbsp;rebellious child within all of us, renew our&nbsp;instinctive energy, and act as a force for change.&nbsp;This is why such literature is worthy of our&nbsp;attention and will endure long after more&nbsp;conventional tales have been forgotten.</span></p>
<div style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid black; background-color: #dddddd;"><strong>Note Q3:</strong> The paragraph is mainly about why children's literature appeals to people. It presents an alternative view of life, it makes fun of conventional views of life, it appeals to the imaginative aspects of people, etc.</div>
<div style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid black; background-color: #dddddd;"><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;<span class="explainq8 explain"><span style="color: #ff69b4;"><strong>Q8</strong></span></span>: In sections B and C the writer says that children's books are subversive and that they make fun of the adult world, but she does not say whether or not adults realise that their children are reading books that contain these features.</div>
<p><span class="font7"><strong>D</strong>&nbsp;An interesting question is what - besides intention - makes a particular story a 'children's&nbsp;book'? With the exception of picture books for&nbsp;toddlers, these works are not necessarily shorter&nbsp;or simpler than so-called adult fiction, and they&nbsp;are surely not less well written. The heroes and&nbsp;heroines of these tales, it is true, are often&nbsp;children: but then so are the protagonists of&nbsp;Henry&nbsp;James's&nbsp;</span><span class="font7">What&nbsp;Maisie&nbsp;Knew</span><span class="font7">&nbsp;and Toni&nbsp;Morrison's&nbsp;</span><span class="font7">The Bluest Eye.</span><span class="font7">&nbsp;<span class="explainq4 explain">Yet the barrier&nbsp;between children's books and adult fiction&nbsp;remains; editors, critics and readers <span class="explainq9 explain">seem to&nbsp;have little trouble</span> in assigning a given work to&nbsp;one category or the other</span>.</span></p>
<div style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid black; background-color: #dddddd;"><span class="font7"><strong>Note Q4:</strong> The main topic of the paragraph is the definition of a children's book and deciding whether a book belongs to that category or not; the writer says that children's books have many things in common with adult fiction, but that people find it easy to decide whether a book can be described as children's literature or not</span></div>
<div style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid black; background-color: #dddddd;"><strong>Note Q9:</strong> In section D the writer says that 'editors' and 'critics’, as well as readers, <strong>'seem to have little trouble</strong>' in classifying books. This means that they continue to classify them in the way they have done previously, and that the distinctions between categories remain clear.</div>
<p><span class="font5"><strong>E</strong>&nbsp;</span><span class="font7">In classic children's fiction a pastoral convention is maintained. It is assumed that the world of&nbsp;childhood is simpler and more natural than that&nbsp;of adults, and that children, though they may&nbsp;have faults, <span class="explainq5 explain">are essentially good or at least&nbsp;capable of becoming so</span>. The <span class="explainq10 explain">transformation</span> of&nbsp;selfish, whiny, disagreeable Mary and hysterical,&nbsp;demanding Colin in Frances&nbsp;Hodgson&nbsp;Burnett's&nbsp;</span><span class="font7">The Secret Garden</span><span class="font7">&nbsp;is a paradigm. Of course,&nbsp;there are often unpleasant minor juvenile&nbsp;characters who give the protagonist a lot of&nbsp;trouble and are defeated or evaded rather than&nbsp;reeducated. But on occasion even the angry&nbsp;bully and the lying sneak can be reformed and&nbsp;forgiven. Richard&nbsp;Hughes</span>'s<span class="explainq11 explain">&nbsp;A High Wind in&nbsp;Jamaica</span><span class="font7">,</span><span class="font7">&nbsp;though most of its characters are&nbsp;children, never appears on lists of recommended&nbsp;juvenile fiction; not so much because of the&nbsp;elaborations of its diction (which is no more&nbsp;complex than that of, say,&nbsp;</span><span class="font7">Treasure Island</span><span class="font7">), but&nbsp;because in it children are irretrievably damaged&nbsp;and corrupted.</span></p>
<div style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid black; background-color: #dddddd;"><span class="font7"><strong>Note Q5</strong>: The main point of the paragraph is that writers of children's literature base their books on the idea that children are good people or that they can become good people. The paragraph then contains examples of this and of a book that cannot be considered a children's book because the children&nbsp;in it do not follow this pattern.</span></div>
<div style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid black; background-color: #dddddd;"><strong>Note Q10:</strong> In section E the writer says that Mary and Colin have a '<strong>transformation</strong>' (major change) in the book, meaning that they become good. They are therefore like the children she talks about in the previous sentence, who she says are typical examples of the children in children's books.</div>
<div style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid black; background-color: #dddddd;"><strong>Note Q11:</strong> In section E the writer says that A High Wind in Jamaica isn't a children's book because the children in it do not have the characteristics that children in what she considers to be children's books have. They are 'irretrievably damaged and corrupted' (they are permanently bad and do not change). The characters of the children are the reason why it isn't a children's book, not the language use, which is not more complex than the language in Treasure Island, which the writer implies is a children's book.</div>
<p><strong><span class="font5">F&nbsp;</span></strong><span class="font7">Adults in most children's books, on the other hand, are <span class="explainq6 explain">usually stuck with their characters and&nbsp;incapable of alteration or growth</span>. If they are&nbsp;really unpleasant, the only thing that can rescue&nbsp;them is the natural goodness of a child. Here&nbsp;again, Mrs. Burnett provides the classic example,&nbsp;in&nbsp;</span><span class="font7">Little Lord Fauntleroy.</span><span class="font7">&nbsp;(Scrooge's somewhat&nbsp;similar change of heart in Dickens's&nbsp;</span><span class="font7"><span class="explainq12 explain">A Christmas&nbsp;Carol</span>,</span><span class="font7">&nbsp;however, is due mainly to regret for his&nbsp;past and terror of the future. This is one of the&nbsp;things that makes the book a family rather than a&nbsp;juvenile romance; another is the helpless&nbsp;passivity of the principal child character, Tiny&nbsp;Tim.).</span></p>
<div style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid black; background-color: #dddddd;"><strong>Note Q6:</strong> The paragraph is mainly about the difference between the adults and the children in children's books. The writer says that this difference is something that means a book can be classified as children's literature, and then gives an example of a book that does not have this characteristic and therefore cannot be called children's literature.</div>
<div style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid black; background-color: #dddddd;"><span class="font7"><strong>Note Q12:</strong> In section F the writer says that one reason why A Christmas Carol isn’t a children's ('juvenile') book is 'the helpless passivity' of Tiny Tim. This means that Tiny Tim cannot and does not try to change anything, whereas the child in Little Lord Fauntleroy is a good example of a child in what the writer considers to be a children's book because he takes action and manages to 'rescue' a bad adult character</span></div>
<p><span class="font7"><strong>G</strong>&nbsp;Of the three principal preoccupations of adult fiction -<span class="explainq7 explain"> sex, money and death</span> - the first is&nbsp;</span><span class="font7">absent from classic children's literature and the other two either absent or much muted. Money is&nbsp;a motive in children's literature, in the sense that&nbsp;many stories deal with a search for treasure of&nbsp;some sort. These quests, unlike real-life ones,&nbsp;are almost always successful, though&nbsp;occasionally what&nbsp;</span><span class="font7">is found in</span><span class="font7">&nbsp;the end is some&nbsp;form of family happiness, which is declared by&nbsp;the author and the characters to be a 'real&nbsp;treasure'. Simple economic survival, however, is&nbsp;almost never the problem; what is sought, rather,&nbsp;is a magical (sometimes literally magical) surplus&nbsp;of wealth. Death, which was a common theme in&nbsp;nineteenth-century fiction for children, was&nbsp;almost banished during the first half of the&nbsp;twentieth century. Since then it has begun to&nbsp;reappear; the breakthrough book was E.B.&nbsp;White's&nbsp;</span><span class="font7">Charlotte's Web.</span><span class="font7">&nbsp;Today not only animals&nbsp;but people die, notably in the sort of books that&nbsp;get awards and are recommended by librarians&nbsp;and psychologists for children who have lost a&nbsp;relative. But even&nbsp;</span><span class="font7">today the characters who die&nbsp;</span><span class="font7">tend to be of another generation; the protagonist&nbsp;and his or her friends survive. Though there are&nbsp;some interesting exceptions, even the most&nbsp;subversive of contemporary children's books&nbsp;usually follow these conventions. They portray&nbsp;an ideal world of perfectible beings, free of the&nbsp;necessity for survival.</span></p>
<div style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid black; background-color: #dddddd;"><strong>Note Q7:</strong> The paragraph is mainly about how the subjects of <strong>sex</strong>, <strong>money</strong> and <strong>death</strong> are presented in children's books.</div>
<div style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid black; background-color: #dddddd;"><strong>Note Q13:</strong>&nbsp; In section G the writer says that money in children's books is not presented in 'real-life' situations but has a 'magical' quality that has nothing to do with the 'simple economic survival' that matters in real life. She is therefore saying that the view of money in children's books is unrealistic. However, she does not say that this is a bad thing; she only says that it is a fact</div>
