            <p><em>Undersea turbines which produce electricity from the tides are set to become an important source of renewable energy for Britain. It is still too&nbsp;early to predict the extent of the impact they may have, but all the signs are&nbsp;that they will play a significant role in the future</em></p>
<p><strong>A</strong></p>
<p>Operating on the same principle as wind turbines, the power in sea turbines comes from tidal currents which turn blades similar to ships’ propellers,&nbsp;but, unlike wind, <span class="explainq5 explain">the tides are predictable and the power input is constant</span>.&nbsp;The technology raises the prospect of Britain becoming self-sufficient in&nbsp;renewable energy and <span class="explainq6 explain">drastically reducing its carbon dioxide emissions</span>. If&nbsp;tide, wind and wave power are all developed, Britain would be able to <span class="explainq7 explain">close&nbsp;gas, coal and nuclear power plants</span> and <span class="explainq8 explain">export renewable power to other&nbsp;parts of Europe</span>. <span class="explainq3 explain">Unlike wind power, which Britain originally developed and&nbsp;then abandoned for 20 years allowing the Dutch to make it a major industry,&nbsp;undersea turbines could become a big export earner to island nations such&nbsp;as Japan and New Zealand.</span></p>
<p><strong>B</strong></p>
<p>Tidal sites have already been identified that will produce one sixth or more of the UK’s power - and at prices competitive with modern gas turbines and&nbsp;undercutting those of the already ailing nuclear industry. One site alone, the&nbsp;Pentland Firth, between Orkney and mainland Scotland, could produce 10%&nbsp;of the country’s electricity with banks of turbines under the sea, and another&nbsp;at Alderney in the Channel Islands three times the 1,200 megawatts of&nbsp;Britain’s largest and newest nuclear plant, Sizewell B, in Suffolk. Other&nbsp;sites identified include the Bristol Channel and the west coast of Scotland,&nbsp;particularly the channel between Campbeltown and Northern Ireland.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong></p>
<p>Work on designs for the new turbine blades and sites are well advanced at the University of Southampton’s sustainable energy research group. <span class="explainq1 explain">The&nbsp;first station is expected to be installed off Lynmouth in Devon</span> shortly to&nbsp;test the technology in a venture jointly funded by the department of Trade&nbsp;and Industry and the European Union. AbuBakr Bahaj, in charge of the&nbsp;Southampton research, said: The prospects for energy from tidal currents&nbsp;are far better than from wind because the flows of water are predictable&nbsp;and constant. <span class="explainq4 explain">The technology for dealing with the hostile saline environment&nbsp;under the sea has been developed in the North Sea oil industry and much&nbsp;is already known about turbine blade design, because of wind power and ship propellers</span>. There are a few technical difficulties, but I believe in the&nbsp;next five to ten years we will be installing commercial marine turbine farms.’&nbsp;Southampton has been awarded £215,000 over three years to develop&nbsp;the turbines and is working with Marine Current Turbines, a subsidiary of&nbsp;IT power, on the Lynmouth project. EU research has now identified 106&nbsp;potential sites for tidal power, 80% round the coasts of Britain. <span class="explainq9 explain">The best&nbsp;sites are between islands or around heavily indented coasts where there are&nbsp;strong tidal currents.</span></p>
<p><strong>D</strong></p>
<p>A marine turbine blade needs to be only one third of the size of a wind&nbsp;generator to produce three times as much power. The blades will be about 20 metres in diameter, so around 30 metres of water is required. Unlike&nbsp;wind power, there are unlikely to be environmental objections. Fish and other&nbsp;creatures are thought unlikely to be at risk from the relatively <span class="explainq11 explain">slow-turning&nbsp;</span>blades. Each turbine will be mounted on a tower which will connect to the&nbsp;national power supply grid via underwater cables. The towers will stick out of&nbsp;the water and be lit, to warn shipping, and also be designed to be lifted out&nbsp;of the water for <span class="explainq10 explain">maintenance</span> and to clean seaweed from the blades.</p>
<p><strong>E</strong></p>
<p>Dr Bahaj has done most work on the Alderney site, where there are&nbsp;powerful currents. <span class="explainq2 explain">The single undersea turbine farm would produce far more power than needed for the Channel Islands and most would be fed into the&nbsp;French Grid and be re-imported into Britain via the cable under the Channel.</span></p>
<p><strong>F</strong></p>
<p>One technical difficulty is cavitation, where <span class="explainq12 explain">low pressure</span> behind a turning&nbsp;blade causes air bubbles. These can cause vibration and damage the blades of the turbines. Dr Bahaj said: ‘We have to test a number of blade types to&nbsp;avoid this happening or at least make sure it does not damage the turbines&nbsp;or reduce performance. Another slight concern is submerged debris floating&nbsp;into the blades. So far we do not know how much of a problem it might&nbsp;be. We will have to make the turbines robust because the sea is a hostile&nbsp;environment, but all the signs that we can do it are good.&nbsp;</p>
