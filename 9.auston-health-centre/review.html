<td class="style7"><strong>A Appointments</strong><br>Please telephone 826969 (8.30am - 5.00pm: Mon - Fri). <span class="explainq5 explain">We suggest that you try to see the same doctor whenever possible because it is helpful for both you and your doctor to know each other well</span>. We try hard to keep our appointments running to time, and ask you to be punctual to help us achieve this; <span class="explainq4 explain">if you cannot keep an appointment, please phone in and let us know as soon as possible</span> so that it can be used for someone else. Please try to avoid evening appointments if possible. Each appointment is for one person only. Please ask for a longer appointment if you need more time.<br><br><strong>B Weekends and Nights</strong><br>Please telephone 823307 and a recorded message will give you the number of the doctor from the Centre on duty. <span class="explainq1 explain">Please remember this is in addition to our normal working day.</span> Urgent calls only please. A Saturday morning emergency surgery is available between 9.30am and 10.00am. Please telephone for home visits before 10.00am at weekends.<br><br><strong>C Centre Nurses</strong><br>Liz Stuart, Martina Scott and Helen Stranger are available daily by appointment to help you with dressings, ear syringing, children's immunisations, removal of stitches and blood tests. They will also advise on foreign travel, and can administer various injections and blood pressure checks. For any over 75s unable to attend the clinic, Helen Stranger will make a home visit. All&nbsp;three Centre Nurses are available during normal working hours to carry out health checks on patients who have been on doctors' lists for 3 years.<br><br><strong>D New Patients</strong><br>Within 3 months of <span class="explainq3 explain">registering with the Centre</span>, new patients on regular medication are invited to attend a health check with their doctor. Other patients can arrange to be seen by one of the Centre Nurses.<br><br><strong>E Services Not Covered</strong><br>Some services are not covered by the Centre e.g. private certificates, insurance, driving and sports medicals, passport signatures, school medicals and prescriptions for foreign travel. There are recommended fees for these set by the National Medical Association. Please ask at reception.<br><br><strong>F Receptionists</strong><br>Our receptionists provide your primary point of contact-they are all very experienced and have a lot of basic information at their fingertips. <span class="explainq2 explain">They will be able to answer many of your initial queries</span> and also act as a link with the rest of the team. <span class="explainq8 explain">They may request brief details of your symptoms or illness</span> - this enables the doctors to assess the degree of urgency.<br><br><strong>G Change of Address</strong><br><span class="explainq9 explain">Please remember to let us know if you decide to relocate</span>. It is also useful for us to have a record of your telephone number.</td>
