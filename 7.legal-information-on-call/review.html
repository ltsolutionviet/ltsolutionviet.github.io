<p><strong>What is Dial-A-Law?</strong></p>
<p><span class="explainq1 explain">Dial-A-Law is a library of pre-recorded messages to provide general information on specific topics of law.</span><span class="explainq3 explain"> You can call this service 24 hours a day, 7 days a week</span> and listen to any tape from our complete library of pre-recorded messages.<br><span class="explainq2 explain">Dial-A-Law provides information, not legal advice</span>. Each legal problem is different so if you have a legal problem you should talk to a solicitor. If you don't have a solicitor, the Legal Referral Service can refer you to a solicitor in your area.<br>While the Dial-A-Law information service is available 24 hours a day,<span class="explainq5 explain"> the Legal Referral Service is open only during normal business hours.</span><br><br><strong>What if I need a solicitor?</strong></p>
<p>If you listen to a Dial-A-Law message after business hours, you can phone the Legal Referral Service during business hours the following day on the number given to you at the end of the message.<br>If you listen to a Dial-A-Law message during business hours and decide you want a referral to a solicitor, press the appropriate number when prompted and <span class="explainq4 explain">you will be automatically transferred to the Legal Referral Service.</span><br>You will be given the names of up to three solicitors in your suburb who practise in the specific area of law you require. You can simply arrange an appointment with one of these solicitors. <span class="explainq7 explain">Then you must contact the Legal Referral Service to obtain a referral letter.</span> You must hand this to the solicitor at the beginning of your interview <span class="explainq6 explain">He or she will give you an initial interview of up to 30 minutes free of charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="explainq8 explain">During the interview the solicitor will tell you if you have a legal case, what is involved, approximately how long it should take to solve the problem, and how much it is likely to cost.</span> Then, if you and the solicitor agree, you may hire the solicitor to handle your problem at his or her normal fee.</p>
